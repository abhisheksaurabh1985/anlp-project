throughout the course of this hospitalization the patient was   found to have left lower extremity dvt status post ivc placement and upon   attempted anticoagulation had a catastrophic rebleed
additionally the   patient has probable right lower extremity arterial clot that has not been   formally visualized on imaging but based on the examination is suspected
also throughout this hospital course the patient had the following   complications  sepsis respiratory failure with trach placement   thrombocytopenia rectal sheath hematoma with intraabdominal bleed status   post iliac and epigastric embolization of arteries renal failure secondary   to ureteral obstruction with bilateral nephrostomy tube placement right mca   cva rectal ischemia and further complications related to her underlying   hypercoagulable state
