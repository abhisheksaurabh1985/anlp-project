recently  a computational study addressed this question and reported that no trna gene for unknown amino acid was found in genome sequences available  
however  no promising candidate for the 23rd amino acid was detected  and only one novel selenoprotein was predicted  
our result suggests that the unknown amino acid encoded by stop codons does not exist  or its phylogenetic distribution is rather limited  which is in agreement with the previous study on trna  
stop codon readthrough is a phenomenon in which the translation process does not terminate at a stop codon  and an amino acid is inserted there instead 12  
in some cases  the inserted amino acid is not one of the 20 amino acids but a noncanonical one  
they analyzed 146 prokaryotic genomes  but no likely trna of the novel amino acid was detected  
actually  trnasec and trnapyl have unusual secondary structures 515 and often escape detection by programs without special consideration  
lobanov et al  thus developed a sensitive search method to deal with this problem  but they also admitted that it would fail to identify highly unusual trnas  
however  this condition is not sufficient  since two major problems remain   pseudogenes and two adjacent genes  
in contrast  if the iorf consists of two adjacent genes  many hits that do not cover the inframe stop codon will be found  
since pseudogenes are less conserved  and sequencing errors are relatively rare events  they will not have homologous iorfs in other species  
even if they do  the position or type  uaa  uag or uga  of their inframe stop codons will not coincide  
in other words  species specific readthrough genes are not in the scope of this study  
based on this observation  each iorf was required to have    i  at least one homolog from other organisms that covers the inframe stop codon and  ii  no homolog that does not cover the stop codon  
instead of the whole length of the amino acid sequence  a window of 101 residues centered at the inframe stop codon was used as a blast query  
whether the codon aligned to the inframe stop codon is a nonsense codon or not was neglected at this stage  
an iorf was discarded if there were any blast hits that do not cover the inframe stop codon  
the three families we failed to find were selw like protein  peroxiredoxin and thiol protein disulphide oxidoreductase  
the reason why the two other families were not detected is more complex  
the cluster was thus discarded because of an apparent lack of stop codon conservation  
hesb family was not clustered into one family  because their sequences were too short and diverged  
selenoprotein families we failed to detect because of nonconserved location of stop codons 
selenoprotein families we failed to detect because of nonconserved location of stop codons  
the genome annotation of m  acetivorans also includes several amber containing genes that were absent from our prediction result  
the reason why they were not detected is that only one species in our dataset had an amber containing form of these proteins  
the successful detection of many known proteins is encouraging  because our method relies only on general properties of proteins that contain stop codon encoded amino acids  but not on specific features of selenocysteine or pyrrolysine  
the n terminal part of the sequence contains five cxxch heme biding motifs  while the c terminal part has no similarity with any characterized proteins  
this is because the inframe stop codons of these proteins are exclusively tga  and all of the above organisms possess selenocysteine insertion machinery  data not shown   
if they are true selenoproteins  this protein family becomes a rare instance of selenoprotein that lacks non selenocysteine homologs  
however  computational analysis of sequences immediately downstream of the inframe stop codons failed to identify secis elements  which is a hallmark of selenocysteine containing genes  
in contrast to the first cluster  no homolog was identified from other species  
this cluster is probably a false positive and not readthrough proteins  
in summary  although a possible selenoprotein was newly identified  there was no promising candidate for an unknown amino acid encoded by a stop codon  
because we have no a priori knowledge about the 23rd amino acid  cutoff thresholds for the filtering procedures were determined based on the known readthrough proteins  
red circle  an organism with pyrrolysine  blue  selenocysteine  yellow  both pyrrolysine and selenocysteine  white  neither pyrrolysine nor selenocysteine  
when top ten organisms were examined  only gluconobacter oxydans was an organism not known to have stop codon encoded amino acids  
because it seems unlikely that an insertion system of novel amino acid evolves solely for transposable elements  this organism cannot be considered as a good candidate of the 23rd amino acid  
however  the result agrees with the filtering dependent analysis that no candidate of the novel stop codon encoded amino acid is detectable in the current dataset  
however  since the target of this study is the 23rd amino acid  and there is no a priori knowledge  only general properties of stop codon encoded amino acids can be used for prediction  
however  both of them did not apply their methods to search for novel amino acids  
therefore  the question of the 23rd amino acid has not been investigated from the viewpoint of coding sequences  
additionally  the previous methods cannot effectively discriminate pseudogenes from readthrough genes  
the previous methods also assume that proteins with stop codon encoded amino acids will have non readthrough homologs  i e   homologous proteins that do not have inframe stop codons   
for example  pyrrolysine containing monomethylamine methyltransferases adopt tim barrel fold 6  but their primary sequences do not exhibit detectable similarity to other tim barrel proteins because of evolutionary divergence  
dimethylamine methyltransferases also lack non readthrough homologs  
therefore  it is important not to assume non readthrough homologs for exploring novel candidates  
the method reported here is unique in that it does not assume non readthrough homologs  
the most likely explanation is that the 23rd amino acid does not exist  or its distribution on the tree of life is rather limited  
yet another possibility is that the 23rd amino acid exists but is not encoded by stop codons  
zhang et al  20 examined the validity of this assumption using a secis based method and concluded that selenoproteins without cysteine homologs will be extremely rare  
therefore  selenoproteins that lack cysteine homologs will be scarce  as previously reported  
the result reported here is in agreement  but it is not conclusive  
at least  only one experimentally confirmed example from a pathogenic strain of escherichia coli 23  whose genome is not yet determined  does not obey this rule  
although many of the currently known selenoproteins and pyrrolysine proteins were successfully detected  no candidate for the 23rd amino acid was discovered  
moreover  it does not assume the occurrence of non readthrough homologs in the public databases  
if an iorf matched any protein coding genes  e value   10 3  and their reading frames did not coincide  the iorf was discarded  
however  if there were any hits  e value   10 5  that did not cover the inframe stop codon  the iorf was discarded  
if the location or type of stop codons was not identical  the cluster was discarded  
if we measure purifying selection for amino acid sequences by the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates  dn ds   a protein with a stop codon encoded amino acid will indicate the sign of selection  while cns will not  
even if both the upstream and downstream regions of the inframe stop codon code proteins  they may be two adjacent genes instead of a readthrough protein  
to enhance sensitivity of the filters  the whole length of an iorf was used as a blast query instead of the partial sequence  and the size of the blast database was increased from the 191 nonredundant genomes to the 328 complete genomes in genomenet and 246 draft genome sequences downloaded from genbank in may 2006  
therefore  in an ideal situation the presence or absence of the 21 residues in alignments will be synchronized  
using a conservative threshold  our most accurate predictor identifies 37606 human interactions  32892  80   of which are not present in other publicly available large human interaction datasets  thus substantially increasing the coverage of the human interaction map  
as such  all combinations of the group a modules can be used to predict interaction in the presence or absence of the transitive module  
in the absence of the transitive module  the preliminary score is used as the final likelihood ratio output by the predictor  
if the transitive module is not considered  the final likelihood ratios assigned to all protein pairs is the preliminary score  ps   
protein pairs that have a posterior odds of interaction above 1 are more likely to interact than not to interact  thus providing an obvious threshold to predict interacting proteins  
however  since the highest likelihood ratio for the expression datasets that we consider is 33  they are not sufficient on their own to predict interacting protein pairs with a posterior odds ratio above 1  
this is not surprising as the transfer of interacting orthologs  known as interologs 33  from one organism to another is a popular method to predict interactions  see for example 3448   particularly in the case of organisms like human for which only a small proportion of interactions are known  
this is not surprising as previous studies have indicated that quite stringent joint e values must be used to transfer interactions safely between organisms 3435  
these features were originally investigated separately  as shown in figure 3  but their combination into one module that considers all dependencies between them achieves higher accuracy  data not shown  and higher likelihood ratios  as can be seen by comparing to figure 1  while still being computationally feasible  
four possible localization states were considered for protein pairs   same compartment  neighboring compartments  different non neighboring compartments and absence of localization annotation  more details are given in the methods section   
this module cannot be used alone as it requires as input the output of at least one group a module  
if the modules were not independent  some likelihood ratios would likely be overestimated  particularly for protein pairs that achieve simultaneously high likelihoods for non independent features  
protein pairs predicted to have a posterior odds ratio below 1 0 have an estimated true positive rate below 50  and thus are more likely not to interact than to interact  
these protein pairs are therefore not of interest in this context  
individual modules do not achieve high scores for the areas under the roc50 and roc100  
in fact  all roc50 auc values achieved by individual modules are below 0 025 and the expression and disorder modules do not predict any protein pairs  positive or negative  above a posterior odds ratio of 1  which is expected as the highest likelihood ratios they achieve are lower than 400  see figure 1a   
however  the disorder module does not contribute significantly to the prediction as predictors that consider it do not  in general  do better than their counterparts that do not use it  
however  this appears to add more noise to the prediction without increasing the accuracy  
once again  the disorder module does not contribute positively to the prediction  
its inclusion does not increase any of the measures of accuracy considered  
in addition  several groups use localization derived negatives  i e  protein pairs that are not annotated as being localized to the same cellular compartment  rather than randomly chosen negatives  see for example 374346   
ratios greater than 100 were not considered because they are computationally infeasible given the size of our datasets and the architecture of the predictor  
when equal numbers of positives and negatives are used in training  the diversity that exists in the non interacting protein pair space may not be captured  thus resulting in misleading likelihood ratios for the predictive modules  
the effect of localization derived negatives rather than randomly chosen negatives was also investigated to see if it would increase the prediction accuracy  
however  one can argue that localization derived negatives might not be able to capture the full diversity of the non interacting protein space since many proteins in the same cellular compartment do not interact  
such predictors may not generalize well when predicting on cell wide protein pairs which consist not only of non colocalized non interacting pairs but also numerous protein pairs that do not interact but are present in the same cellular compartment  
the combined module for these predictors only considers domains and ptms but not subcellular localization as this would result in using this feature both in the selection of the training set and as a feature predictive of interaction  
this is most likely due to the fact that the localization derived negative trained predictor cannot take full advantage of the transitive module  since the network resulting from the predictions of the group a modules likely does not sample the whole protein pair space well  
to do this  all protein pairs were considered that achieve an estimated posterior odds ratio   1 when the eoct predictor was trained on the full datasets without cross validation  
however  as previously noted  the highest likelihood provided by this module is 33 and thus the expression module cannot predict interaction on its own  
when either of these two modules is absent  fewer than 12500 interactions are predicted  
as the majority of the lr400 interactions are derived from the combined and transitive modules  it is possible that the method is identifying a large subset of interactions that are not common to previous human protein interaction datasets  
the ramani interaction dataset that was automatically extracted from the literature 16 as well as all new interactions present in the october 2006 version of the manually curated hprd database 15  but none of the interactions also present in earlier versions of the hprd which were used to train our predictor  were taken as reference datasets  
we estimated false positive rates for each of the datasets by comparing them two by two to one of the reference datasets  thus generating 4 to 6 different estimates of false positive rates for each computational dataset  as shown in figure 6a  the two lehner datasets were not compared to each other  which is why they have fewer fpr estimates   
it should be noted that the rhodes  lehner and ramani datasets annotate interactions as a relationship between human genes and not their protein products directly  
both the rhodes dataset and our lr400 dataset predict interactions involving many proteins that are not even present in their positive training set  the hprd   
many of the predictions in these two datasets concern protein pairs and proteins that are not present in other datasets  suggesting that they cover different regions of the human interaction space  
we do not compare our predictions to this dataset because such a threshold of tp fp   1 does not correspond to a posterior odds threshold   1  
we do not believe that the quality of this large number of predictions is high enough to warrant their publication since the great majority of these protein pairs achieve a posterior odds ratio below 1  
although the overlap between the lr400 dataset and the hprd derived positive training set is below 10  as shown in figure 6c  the proportion of interactions common to these two sets is not equally distributed for all posterior odds ratios of interaction values  
although many of these novel predictions have not been previously investigated in the literature  there exists experimental evidence supporting a subset of these predictions which is not present in the june 2006 version of the hprd used to train our predictor  thus providing independent validation of our method  
by considering several different types of orthogonal and quite distinct features including expression  orthology  combined protein characteristics and local network topology  we predicted over 37000 human protein interactions and explored a subspace of the human interactome that has not been investigated by previous large interaction datasets  
duplicate interactions and self interactions were not considered  
additionally  some proteins were not recovered in the conversion between different identifiers  
some gene gene entries were not recovered in the conversion between different identifiers  or due to the deletion or replacement of some entrez locus ids  
if the features are not independent  all possible combinations of all states of these features must be considered  which can be computationally quite intensive  
additionally  when no data are available for a specific feature  for a given pair of proteins   the likelihood of the feature is set to 1 0  
the prior odds ratio  oprior  is difficult to estimate because we do not know all the true interactions  even for a small subset of proteins  
the prior odds ratio of interaction for yeast was estimated by combining all protein protein interactions  but only those related to direct physical interactions  and no entries derived by synthetic lethal type experiments  from the bind  dip and grid databases 656669  
accordingly  it is reasonable to conclude that there are not enough known human interactions to calculate a realistic and stable estimate of the prior odds ratio of interactions for human  
the low confidence bins were filled by human protein pairs that have interacting orthologs according to inparanoid but neither achieves a score of 1  i e  neither is the best match for the two human proteins under consideration   
pslt  protein subcellular localization tool  subcellular localization predictions 54 were used to classify protein pairs in one of four groups   pairs of proteins predicted to be in the same compartment  pairs of proteins predicted to be in neighboring compartments  cytosol nucleus  endoplasmic reticulum golgi  golgi cytosol  cytosol plasma membrane  and plasma membrane secreted   pairs of proteins predicted in different non neighboring compartments and pairs of proteins for which there were no localization predictions  
the transitive module investigates whether two proteins  such as i and j  that share many common interactors and have few additional interactors that are not common to both proteins are more likely to interact than two proteins  such as i  and j   that share few common interactors  
it should be noted that the neighborhood topology score calculated for a given protein pair does not consider the preliminary score assigned to that protein pair  
samples of the protein pair space were taken instead of considering the whole space as this was more computationally tractable  
by building on components that efficiently search for motifs without user defined parameters  scope requires as input only a set of upstream sequences and a species designation  making it a practical choice for non expert users  
program parameters  such as motif length  number of occurrences and orientation  that cannot be reasonably specified by the user without prior knowledge about the true binding sites are referred to as nuisance parameters 4  
guidance on the specific parameter settings to use for given motif finding situations is not provided in most publications presenting motif finders  
previous studies over smaller numbers of motif finders have found that no program clearly stands out as superior to the others and each program outperforms all others on some subset of the regulons 678  
in this context  we note that tompa et al  5 found that  although every motif finding program tested had some regulons on which its performance was clearly superior  it was not possible a priori to predict which motif finder represented the best choice under any given set of conditions 5  
rather than randomly restarting the same search algorithm or comparing multiple search strategies that all search for the same global optimum  and are potentially vulnerable to the same local optima   our algorithm assumes that the   biological significance surface   primarily consists of three local optima  and that one of these peaks represents the global optimum  
we have previously demonstrated that the greedy search strategies employed by each of these methods allow them to reliably search their respective motif domains without the use of nuisance parameters  as the algorithms themselves efficiently optimize the parameters that are typically forced on the users 101112  
the resulting ensemble algorithm  scope  has no nuisance parameters and performs significantly better than its component algorithms  
while alternative representations  such as position weight matrices  pwms  are more expressive  their heuristic searches are prone to local optima and often do not perform well in practice  34111213   
for bacteria and drosophila  upstream regions are defined to be the intergenic region upstream of each gene  thus  the ks objective function is not used  
all values of m are not  however  equally likely a priori  
in contrast  we have proposed that all characters should not be treated equally  but should be penalized in proportion to the information provided by them 1112  
by this logic    acgt   will not be penalized differently from   acnnnngt    as both have the same number of bases that contribute any information to protein dna binding  
indeed  previous studies have reported little or no correlation between the significance measures of various motif finders and measures of accuracy 416  
different sig values were achieved by varying the number of upstream regions  the number of motifs per upstream region  and the number of extraneous upstream regions without planted motifs  
an ensemble motif finder with a learning rule that is no better than random will provide an accuracy that is equal to the average of its three component algorithms  
nuisance parameters are parameters that cannot be precisely defined without knowledge of the true binding sites  such as motif length  number of occurrences and orientation   
scope has no user adjustable parameters  although its component algorithms do contain a number of internal parameters    hyperparameters    that govern their search over common nuisance parameters  
we have therefore fixed those parameters to reasonable values and do not expose them to the user 101112  
corroborating the results of previously published performance comparisons  14567   none of the other programs showed a statistically significant difference relative to the other nine  
similarly  none of scope s component algorithms outperformed the other ten programs on this dataset by a statistically significant margin  
in contrast  none of the other motif finders that performed well by one criterion performed well by the other  as shown by the average ranks for each motif finder over both sensitivity and ppv  figure 6b   
in cases where the program failed to return a result  the sensitivity is 0 and the ppv is undefined  
cases where a program did not support the species were not included  
adding sequences that do not contain binding sites decreases the signal to noise ratio  making motif finding more difficult 4  
yet remarkably  performance comparisons consistently reveal disappointing performance for motif finders and fail to find any statistical significance between them  
conversely  the pwm based methods have an apparently more powerful motif model 17  but their search strategies cannot guarantee optimality and often terminate at local optima  
the limitation arises  however  in regulons where only one program has a high accuracy and the others fail to find any portion of the binding sites  
in this light  scope can be seen as leveraging the second key observation by embracing the no free lunch theorem   rather than boost average performance by taking the average results of three general purpose algorithms  scope uses highly specialized algorithms and assumes each will perform strongly on some regulons and weakly on others  and that the unified scoring metric can tell the difference   
these observations are not offered as definitive proof that there are only three classes of motifs  rather  they show that power can be gained by identifying distinct motif classes and combining specialized algorithms with a unified scoring rule  
although our test set of 78 regulons gave us enough power to find significance between scope and its components or other algorithms  it did not provide enough power to disentangle the effects of small improvements  such as the bonferroni correction  the objective function that takes position bias into account  or scoring motifs based off one or both strands   especially in the rigorous cross validation framework necessary to decipher precisely which aspects contribute significantly to the performance  
whereas previous performance comparisons attempt to optimize the parameters of the programs in question 467 or allow expert users to tune their own programs and manually filter both the input and output 5 we intentionally made our comparisons between programs without manually optimizing any parameters for any species so as to emulate typical use conditions  
although the present philosophy of performance comparison implicitly benefits scope  which has no parameters to optimize  it is arguably the most relevant comparison possible for the typical biologist  
especially poor performance on drosophila was also reported in the tompa et al  performance comparison  indicating that this difficulty is not limited to the current dataset 5  
thus  the background sequences used by scope and the other programs may not be representative of the   true   background model of enhancers  leading to inaccurate statistics  
ensemble methods hold the potential for providing improvements in motif finding accuracy without resorting to the use of additional data  such as phylogenetic information or characterization of the domain structure of the transcription factor   which are not always available  
since the latter cannot be defined without data that obviates the need for computational motif finding  objective functions that approximate biological significance are critical  
while this objective function prevents a single upstream region from dominating a motif s score  it fails to account for multiple instances of a binding site in a single gene that may arise due to cooperative binding  
most programs assume motif orientation does not matter and so define m   mr  
however  none of these approaches offers structural evidence that the predicted domain pairs are able to form an interaction  
given that 74  of all uniprot proteins contain at least one pfam match  this is not by itself surprising  
the columns are split according to the proportion of interactions that contain an ipfam domain pair  blue   that contain any other pfam domains on both proteins  red   and those that contain no pfam domain pair  yellow   
no p value  see methods  was greater than 1 84    10 06  
in both h  sapiens  blue  and s  cerevisiae  green  a small number of ipfam domain pairs covers a large fraction of the interactome  whereas in e  coli  no ipfam domain occurs in more than 4 experimental interactions at a time  
without further experiments  we cannot assign the correct interacting domains with certainty  
to gain a rough estimate of the false positive rate due to this assumption  we counted how many protein pairs in the pdb contain an ipfam domain pair that does not mediate an interaction in one complex structure but does so in another  
3671 out of a total of 5380 interacting protein pairs from the pdb contain an ipfam domain pair that does not interact in one complex structure but does so in another  
thus  some complexes contain a greater number of ipfam domain pairs  while other complexes do not contain any at all  
the grey set in the background represents ipfam domain pairs not found in the three species  
even in h  sapiens  where we suspect a positive bias due to the overrepresentation of disease related proteins in both the pdb and protein interaction databases  81  of protein interactions do not contain an ipfam domain pair  
 while there is no structural information about putative interactions between these pairs  this fraction can already be analysed using statistical methods to identify putative domain interactions 7910  
the significant positive correlation in the frequency of ipfam domain pairs conserved between s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens also suggests that the binding interfaces are more often kept or even reused rather than lost in the course of evolution  
an average of     16  of interaction entries were lost in the mapping process  either if no sequence was provided with the original entry or if no significant matching sequence could be found in integr8  
it should be noted that the degree distribution per node is not maintained  
while the neur and mib genes are evolutionarily conserved  their respective roles in the context of a single organism have not yet been examined  
finally  ectopic expression of neur in d mib mutant larvae rescues the wing d mib phenotype  indicating that neur can compensate for the lack of d mib activity  
for instance  dl  but not ser  is essential for lateral inhibition during early neurogenesis in the embryo  4   
conversely  ser  but not dl  is specifically required for segmental patterning  5   
these different requirements for dl and ser appear to primarily result from their non overlapping expression patterns rather than from distinct signaling properties  
accordingly  signaling would not be linked directly to endocytosis  but endocytosis would be prerequisite for signaling  30   
the d mib1 and d mib2mutant alleles did not complement the l 3 72cdaj12 and l 3 72cdai5 lethal mutations that have been mapped to the same cytological interval as the d mib gene  35   
third  western blot analysis showed that the d mib protein was not detectable in imaginal disc and brain complex extracts prepared from homozygous d mib1 and d mib1 d mib2 larvae  figure 1c and c    
fourth  the leaky  gal4 independent expression of a uas d mib transgene fully rescued the lethality of d mib1 d mib2 flies  data not shown  see also figure 1h   
the endogenous d mib protein  predicted size  130 kda  was detected in s2 cells  lane 2  and in imaginal discs from wild type larvae  lane 3  but was not detectable in homozygous d mib1  lane 4  and d mib1 d mib3  lane 5  third instar larvae  
d mib mutant flies showed a weak neurogenic phenotype  j  that was not observed in ser mutant flies  k   
ectopic sensory organs in d mib mutant flies developed from ectopic sensory organ precursor cells  not shown   
mutant pupae died as pharate adults showing ectopic macrochaetes  increased microchaete density on the dorsal thorax  figure 1i and 1j   short legs lacking tarsal segmentation  figure 1l and 1m   and nearly complete loss of eye and wing tissues  figure 1d and 1e   
hypomorphic d mib2 d mib4 mutant flies only showed ectopic sensory organs  rough eyes  small wings  and thickened veins  figure 1d  1d   1g  and 1g   data not shown   
more specifically  the bristle and leg phenotypes are likely to result from reduced signaling by dl  and not by ser   
in contrast  a complete loss of ser signaling had no effect on bristle density  figure 1k   
 f and f   expression of cut  red  at the wing margin was not affected by the complete loss of neur activity in neur1f65 mutant clones  indicated by the loss of the nuclear green fluorescent protein  gfp  marker  in green   
a complete loss of cut and wg accumulation and wg lacz expression was observed in the central region of third instar d mib mutant wing discs  data not shown   
interestingly  wing margin formation and expression of cut are not affected by the complete loss of neur activity  figure 2f and 2f    45   
similarly  loss of neur activity had no detectable effect on leg segmentation  data not shown  and vein determination  45   two processes shown here to depend on d mib gene activity  
 f   f    d mib staining at the apical cortex  blue in  f and f    was not detected in d mib2 mutant clone  marked by loss of nuclear gfp staining  green in  f    
loss of d mib activity has no detectable effect on the apical accumulation of dl  red in  f and f      
in contrast  ventral clones did not prevent the expression of cut  c and d   implying that d mib is not strictly required for dl signaling  
note that mutant ventral cells abutting wild type dorsal cells expressed cut  arrow in  d    indicating that d mib is not required for n signal transduction  
we focused our analysis on the notum region since d mib mutant discs have no wing pouch  figure 4   
the complete loss of d mib activity in d mib1 mutant discs did not detectably change the subcellular localization of dl  figure 4c  4c   4f  and 4f    
similar results were also obtained in d mib2 mutant clones  which showed strongly elevated levels of cortical ser  figure 4h  whereas the amount of dl at the apical cortex was not detectably modified  see figures 3f   3f   and 4j   
of note  loss of d mib2 activity in clones did not block the accumulation of ser into intracellular dots  figure 4h    
the distribution of dl  red in  j and j    was not affected by the loss of d mib activity  
briefly  dissected wing discs were cultured for 15 min in the presence of antibodies that recognize the extracellular part of ser or dl  then washed  cultured for another 45 min in medium without antibodies  and then fixed  
the complete loss of d mib activity in d mib1 wing discs did not significantly change the internalization of anti dl antibodies  figure 5d      5e      and 5f       indicating that d mib is not required for dl endocytosis in this tissue  
the lack of cut expression in wild type ventral cells abutting the d v boundary indicates that d mib is required for ser signaling by dorsal cells and acts in a non autonomous manner to activate n in ventral cells  
conversely  loss of d mib activity in large ventral clones  figure 6c and 6d  did not disrupt margin specification  indicating that d mib is not strictly required for dl signaling by ventral cells  
of note  ventral d mib mutant cells expressed cut  implying that d mib is not required for n signal transduction  
by contrast  elevated levels of ser expression failed to restore cut expression and growth of the wing pouch in d mib2 d mib3 mutant larvae  figure 8b   
d mib2 d mib3 mutant discs expressing gfp  a   gfp staining not shown   ser  b   ncdc10  c   or neur  d  under the control of ser gal4 were stained for cut  red   
expression of ser in dorsal cells did not rescue the d mib2 d mib3 wing pouch mutant phenotype  compare  b  with  a    consistent with d mib being required for ser signaling  
consistent with the latter hypothesis  the neur gene is not expressed in wing pouch and wing margin cells  where it is not required  and appears to be expressed only in sensory cells  52   where it is required  
expression of neur  using actin gal4  restored growth of the wing pouch and formation of the wing margin  data not shown   
in a converse experiment  we found that the neur driven expression of d mib  using neurpgal4  did not rescue the cuticular neurogenic phenotype of neurpgal4 neur1f65 embryos  
three uas d mib transgenic lines were tested  and none showed detectable rescue whereas the two uas neur lines used as positive controls either fully or partially rescued the cuticular neurogenic phenotype of neurpgal4 neur1f65 embryos  data not shown  uas d mib     neurpgal4    embryos developed normally   
this indicates that a key function of neur in the embryo cannot be provided by d mib  
third  results from an in vivo antibody uptake assay indicated that the endocytosis of ser  but not of dl  was strongly inhibited in d mib mutant cells  
this inhibition correlated with the strong accumulation of ser  but not dl  at the apical cortex of d mib mutant cells  
by analogy  the defective growth of the eye tissue may similarly result from the lack of ser signaling and of n activation along the d v boundary  55   
this conclusion is consistent with observations made earlier showing that secreted versions of ser cannot activate n but instead antagonize ser signaling  56 57   
interestingly  the strong requirement for dl and ser endocytosis seen in drosophila is not conserved in caenorhabditis elegans  in which secreted ligands have been shown to be functional  58 59   
noticeably  there is no c  elegans mib homolog  and the function of c  elegans neur  f10d7 5  is not known  
we have shown that the d mib gene regulates wing margin formation  leg segmentation  and vein formation  whereas none of these three processes depend on neur gene activity   45 60   this study   
conversely  the activity of the neur gene is essential for binary cell fate decisions in the bristle lineage  22  that do not require the activity of the d mib gene  no bristle defects were seen in d mib mutant flies   
the functional differences observed between d mib and neur cannot be simply explained by obvious differences in molecular activity and or substrate specificity  
we have shown here that specific aspects of the d mib phenotype in legs and in the notum cannot simply result from loss of ser signaling and are consistent with reduced dl signaling  suggesting that d mib regulates dl signaling  
we note  however  that no clear defects in dl subcellular localization and or trafficking were observed in d mib mutant cells  
consistent with this idea  overexpression of neur in imaginal discs resulted in a strong reduction of ser accumulation at the apical cortex  data not shown   
nevertheless  our observation that d mib could not compensate for the loss of neur activity in the embryo indicates that d mib and neur have overlapping rather than identical molecular activities  
for instance  neur  but not d mib  localizes asymmetrically during asymmetric sensory organ precursor cell divisions  22   
the l 3 72cdaj12 and l 3 72cdai5 alleles originally isolated by  35  failed to complement the d mib1 and d mib2 mutations and were renamed d mib3 and d mib4  
yet no transposase sequence similar to rag1 or rag2 has been found  
we also suggest that the rag2 protein was not encoded by ancient transib transposons but emerged in jawed vertebrates as a counterpart of rag1 necessary for the v d j recombination reaction  
because the vast repertoire of bcrs and tcrs cannot be encoded genetically  ancestors of jawed vertebrates adopted an elegant combinatorial solution  1   
however  given the lack of significant structural similarities between rags and known tpases  the    rag transposon    model  9 12 13 16  remained unproven  
a lack of any labels means that the transib tpase and rag1 2 are not present in the sequenced portions of the corresponding genomes  
among branches lacking transib tpases  only lamprey and crocodile genomes are not extensively sequenced to date  
at the same time  recently sequenced genomes of honeybee  roundworms  fish  frog  mammals  sea squirts  plants  and fungi  except soybean rust  do not contain any detectable transib transposons  see figure 1   
each empty cell indicates that the corresponding tpase query was not used at the particular stage of psi blast analysis  
however  based on psi blast searches  no significant similarities between these nine tpases and rag1 protein were found  data not shown   
indigenous properties of the transib tpase  that were not related directly to rag1 functions  including those responsible for the precise 5 bp length of tsds  might have been altered during evolution of rag1  leading to occasional 4 bp and 3 bp tsds that are atypical for transib transposons  
extensive analysis of the flanks failed to show any hallmarks of putative transposons that might be associated with this rag1 like protein  and we did not find any evidence indicating that other rag1 core   like proteins are encoded by transposable elements  figure 5   
although the two proteins are only 38  identical to each other  they share common features   1  their n terminal portions are missing and the rag1 like sequences start at positions 17 or 18   2  in both proteins the first aa residue overlaps with the acceptor splice site  and  3  their similarity to rag1 starts at positions corresponding to position 470 of the human rag1  
again  as in the case of the sea urchin sequences  the lancelet rag1 core   like elements show no hallmarks of transposons  data not shown   
even without the finger  the remaining portions of the sea urchin sequences were significantly similar to the corresponding portions of rag1  
blastp searches of the sea urchin sequences against all genbank proteins  excluding rag1  detected only the ring finger domain of the sea urchin sequences  
e values of these matches were much higher than the e values of similarities to the rag1 proteins  sp_768  0 04 versus 7  10 7  sp_86231  3  10 4 versus 7  10 7  sp_1226  10 4 versus 2  10 7  p4_sp  10 versus 2  10 7  p5_sp does not have ring finger and matches rag1 only  e value    9  10 7   
based on the same approach  our study found that the starlet sea anemone and hydra genomes also encode several families of the n terminal rag1 domain that appear to be separate from the rag1 core   like proteins  data not shown   
because there were no known tpases similar to rag1  it could be argued that rag1 independently developed some tpase like properties  rather than deriving them from a te encoded tpase  24   
so far  we have found no evidence of such similarities  
nevertheless  based on the orientations and relative positions of these transposons  none of them appears to be associated with the rag1 like sequences  see figure 5   
we also could not identify the 5 bp tsds and tirs characteristic of the transib superfamily  
the n terminal domain of rag1 has long been viewed as distinct from the core domain due to its lack of direct involvement in the v d j recombination reaction  
in the sea urchin  lancelet  hydra  and starlet sea anemone genomes  the rag1 core   like sequences and the n terminal domain   like sequences do not appear to be linked to each other or to any other proteins  
again  it is unclear if this part is not present in sea urchins or simply undetectable due to its small size and the high sequence divergence  
however  none of the transib transposons identified so far encode any proteins other than the transib rag tpase  
also  we could not find any rag2 like sequences in the recently sequenced sea urchin  lancelet  hydra  and sea anemone genomes  which encode rag1 like sequences  
nevertheless  the apparent lack of rag2 like proteins in the sequenced portion of the sea urchin  lancelet  hydra  and sea anemone genomes  as well as in transib transposons suggests that rag2 was introduced in a separate event in jawless vertebrates  
however  given the low 30  identity between the rag1 and sea urchin lancelet sea squirt rag1 like proteins  we cannot exclude the possibility that the ancestral rag2 protein went through a period of strong diversification driven by positive selection  and it can no longer be identified by sequence comparisons but may still be present in invertebrates  
in any case  the origin of the v d j recombination system in jawless vertebrates appears to be a culmination of earlier evolutionary processes rather than an isolated event associated with insertion of a single transposon  
the remaining portion of the zfb motif was probably lost in tpases of insect transib transposons  which do not encode rag2 like proteins  
however  although the observed biochemical relationship between the hat tpase and v d j recombination is a step forward in our understanding of transposition reaction  several arguments strongly suggest that v d j machinery evolved from a transib rather than from hat transposon  
first  as we mentioned previously  there is no significant sequence identity between hat tpases and rag1  even if one employs a psi blast search with most relaxed parameters  i e   e   10  no filters  no composition based statistics   
no transib tpases had been deposited or annotated previously in genbank  except for two short hypothetical proteins predicted automatically during annotation of the d  melanogaster genome  151 aa gi 30923617 and 123 aa gi 30923765  
the process is repeated for a specific number of iterations or until convergence  when no additional proteins are added on successive iterations  
to ensure that a conservation profile for the transib tpases and rag1 proteins was not produced by a systematic error  we employed a procedure of    step wise    psi blast iterations  
the following protocol describes the procedure   1  use a genbank set combined with n number of transib tpases  in our studies  n was equal to 7  13  and 18    2  run psi blast against genbank combined with tpases using each tpase as a query or seed   3  select only transib tpase sequences with e values less than 10 5 to define the pssm   4  take the best e value  ei  obtained by psi blast for rag1s when pssm is constructed without rag1  then  5  repeat these operations for different numbers  n  of tpases  
presence and absence of corresponding residues in the transib tpases are indicated by   and    respectively  
internal portions of transposons are not shown and are marked by xxx  
it is also clear from the alignment that the hat termini do not have any second conserved block  which is expected to be preserved if rsss have evolved from hat termini  
the elevated level of adenosine in the hemolymph due to lack of adgf a leads to apparently inconsistent phenotypic effects  precocious metamorphic changes including differentiation of macrophage like cells and fat body disintegration on one hand  and delay of development with block of pupariation on the other  
without intervention  the affected individuals die from opportunistic infections within the first few months of life  
ada is not the only adenosine deaminase in mammalian cells  
drosophila also contains a gene  termed ada  with sequence similarity to human ada  but as we have previously shown the product of this gene is most likely not an active ada  16   
melanization of the lymph glands was never observed in these larvae  and the imaginal discs and brain appear normal  
homozygous pupae usually die soon after pupariation  in some cases they develop normal head and thorax imaginal structures  however  abdominal parts usually do not develop  
less than 2  of mutant pupae develop normally and eventually emerge as adults without any obvious abnormalities besides the abdominal curvature  some of them are sterile  
the adgf a homozygous flies carrying the hs adgf a construct showed survival rates significantly higher than adgf a even without heat shock  probably due to leaky expression of the hs adgf a construct  figure 2a   
along the x axis  which is shared with  b    the rescue experiments are shown  marked by the gal4 driver used for expression of adgf a except for first three sets of bars   the first set presents only an adgf a mutant  the second an adgf a mutant carrying hs adgf a construct without heat shock  and the third with heat shock  and the y axis represents percentage of pupae and adult flies out of the total number of transferred first instar larvae of particular genotype  
two different lines carrying the wild type uas adgf a expression construct together with an actin gal4 driver  providing ubiquitous expression  both completely rescued the mutant phenotype  whereas larvae with uas adgf a but without the driver showed the typical mutant phenotype  
however  neither of the two lines carrying the mutated version of the uas adgf a  producing full length protein detected by anti myc antibody  see materials and methods  showed any rescue of the mutant phenotype  
an average of 7  of hemocytes in the adgf a mutant are lamellocytes  figures 3 and 4e   large flat cells that are not present in circulation of wild type larvae under normal conditions  19   
the lymph glands normally do not release hemocytes into the hemolymph before metamorphosis  20   instead  they are released during metamorphosis when the lymph glands disperse  19   
no line expressing the gal4 driver exclusively in the lymph glands has been reported  so we used a combination of lines sharing in common the feature of gal4 driver expression in the lymph glands  
the results  see figure 2 and table 1  clearly demonstrate that expression of adgf a in the lymph glands  driven by cg gal4 e33c gal4  or c564 gal4   but not in any other tissue examined  is necessary and sufficient to fully rescue the adgf a lethality  
the c564 gal4 driver is not expressed as strongly as e33c gal4  but is still uniformly expressed in the lymph glands  it also fully rescued the mutant phenotype  
the dot gal411c on chromosome ii  which shows weak expression  24   did not rescue the phenotype  but a dot gal443a insertion on chromosome x  which shows stronger expression  rescued approximately half of the mutant animals  figure 2   
nearly all rescued individuals were males  suggesting that expression of the gal4 driver was influenced by x chromosome dosage compensation  and expression in females heterozygous for dot gal4 was not strong enough for rescue  
expression of adgf a in salivary glands and fat body  as well as in other tissues  is not required for full rescue  as demonstrated by use of the cg gal4 dot gal4  but especially by e33c gal4 driver  and is also not sufficient to rescue the phenotype at all  as demonstrated by t110 gal4 and lsp2 gal4  table 1   
no rescue of the phenotype  including body shape of escaping pupae  was observed  
the only line showing significant  but not complete  rescue of adgf a survival without expression in the lymph glands was gawb5015  see figure 2   which expresses the gal4 driver very strongly and specifically in the ring gland and salivary glands  as well as very weak and spotty expression in imaginal discs  unpublished data    
however  expression of adgf a driven by gawb5015 does not prevent the formation of melanotic tumors  see figure 2b   
however  the delay in development and block of pupariation  figure 6b   as well as the pupal body shape  were not influenced by this mutation  
the number of crystal cells was not increased and lamellocytes were not detected in crq  adgf a double mutants  see figure 3   
none of the double mutant larvae showed either disintegration of fat body or melanotic tumor formation  figure 6a   
even the adgf a mutant larvae heterozygous for the crq mutation  crq cyo gfp  adgf a adgf a  showed significant suppression of the fat body disintegration  with most of the tissue staying compact in bigger pieces and never disintegrating to single adipose cells  melanotic tumors were rarely observed  
in addition  the absence of lamellocytes and the normal number of crystal cells in the double mutant strongly suggest that the differentiation of these cells and thus melanotic tumor formation is a secondary reaction to fat body disintegration  rather than a primary effect of the adgf a mutation  
these results demonstrate that adenosine signaling through the adenosine receptor is involved in the developmental arrest of adgf a mutant  but that it does not play a role in fat body disintegration and macrophage differentiation  
some mutants show typical expulsion from the glands with gfp totally external to the puparial case  e   while others do not expel glue proteins even after puparium formation  f   
the block of pupariation in the adgf a mutant suggested that the level of ecdysone in these larvae might not be sufficient to initiate pupariation  
however  the overall structure of the ring gland is not visibly affected even in the oldest larvae  10 d  i e   5 d after the heterozygous siblings pupariated  with a fully disintegrated fat body  figure 7b and 7c   
in some cases  gfp was secreted into the lumen of salivary glands  but was not expectorated  figure 7f   which is similar to the defect seen in animals expressing the dominant negative form of ecdysone receptor driven by the sgs3 gal4 driver  33   
although our tests did not exclude a role for adgf a in circulating hemocytes  which constitute a separate lineage from the lymph gland hemocytes  20    we showed that expression of adgf a in circulating hemocytes is not required for rescue of the adgf a mutant phenotype  since e33c gal4 uas adgf a which expresses adgf a in the lymph gland but not in circulating hemocytes fully rescued the phenotype  
although these cells share other characteristics with plasmatocytes  they are normally not seen in circulation until they are released from the lymph glands at the onset of metamorphosis under the regulation of ecdysone to serve as phagocytes for histolysing tissues during metamorphosis   thus  they are referred to as pupal macrophages  19   
this indication of precocious metamorphic changes  36  in the mutant is further supported by the finding that hemocytes aggregate in a segmental pattern in early rather than late third instar  see figure 4h   4j   and that the hemocytes lose expression of hemolectin in late third instar larvae rather than at the onset of metamorphosis  see figure 4g   21   
a similar role of croquemort for removing histolysing tissues during drosophila metamorphosis has not yet been tested  but seems likely since the crq mutant used in this study  crqkg01679  is lethal in pupae  
this protein was suggested to be a scavenger receptor  but it does not seem to be homologous to drosophila croquemort  unpublished data   
adenosine could serve as a signal for macrophage differentiation  and the lack of adenosine deaminase activity due to the adgf a mutation could cause precocious differentiation of these cells in mutant larvae  
one possible explanation for the developmental delay and failure to pupariate is that the adgf a mutation affects the production or release of ecdysteroid hormones from the major endocrine organ of the drosophila larva   the ring gland  
other mutants with hormonal dysregulation show delayed larval development and failure to pupariate  42 43   
the mutation in ador does not block macrophage differentiation and fat body disintegration  so this effect must involve another  as yet uncharacterized mechanism independent of ador signaling  
although the adgf a mutation leads to larval or pupal death  we have shown that this is not due to the adenosine or deoxyadenosine simply blocking cellular proliferation or survival  as the experiments in vitro would suggest  
indeed  most mitochondria released all their cytochrome c within a one minute period in a temperature independent manner  suggesting that an enzymatic transport mechanism is probably not involved  
there is no apparent need for cytochrome c release in c  elegans  since ced 4 does not require it to activate ced 3  
the drosophila bok homolog interacts with several anti apoptotic  but not with several pro apoptotic  bcl 2 family members and  therefore  possibly functions by antagonizing pro survival proteins  
while one group reports that the caspase inhibitor p35 can block apoptosis induced by drosophila bok  22   another group did not see p35 inhibition  23   
one notable exception is that the c elegans homologs of iaps do not appear to function in programmed cell death  
the three proteins encoded by these genes have no significant homology to any other known proteins except for a small stretch of similarity at the amino terminus that is shared by all three but no other known proteins  
although diablo smac shares no sequence homology with reaper  hid  or grim  it too can bind iaps  preventing them from inhibiting caspase activation  and thereby inducing apoptosis  
an important difference between the function of diablo smac and reaper  hid  and grim is that diablo smac is not pro apoptotic by itself when overexpressed  but instead requires a death inducing stimulus to promote apoptosis  unlike the three drosophila proteins  
in fact  saccharomyces cerevisiae contains neither caspases nor an apoptotic program  but it does have an iap like protein with a single bir domain that functions in regulating cell division  41   suggesting that the iaps are diverse family with only some members being anti apoptotic  hence this protein family is more accurately referred to as bir containing proteins  birps   
using information from the genome project  c  elegans was shown to contain several potential caspases in addition to ced 3  but none of these has been shown to function in programmed cell death  9   
in addition  while c  elegans has two bir domain containing proteins  neither appears to regulate cell death  bir 1 has been demonstrated to be essential for cytokinesis instead  39   
the msl proteins colocalize to hundreds of sites along the single male x chromosome  they all are essentia
