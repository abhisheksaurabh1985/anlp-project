					<sentence id="S1.2">The production of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) progeny was followed in the U937 promonocytic cell line after stimulation either with retinoic acid or PMA, and in purified human monocytes and macrophages.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.3">Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Southwestern blotting experiments were used to detect the binding of cellular transactivation factor NF-KB to the double repeat-KB enhancer sequence located in the long terminal repeat.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.4">PMA treatment, and <xcope id="X1.4.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.4.1">not</cue> retinoic acid treatment of the U937 cells</xcope> acts in inducing NF-KB expression in the nuclei.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.5">In nuclear extracts from monocytes or macrophages, induction of NF-KB occurred only if the cells were previously infected with HIV-1.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.6">When U937 cells were infected with HIV-1, <xcope id="X1.6.3"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.6.3">no</cue> induction of NF-KB factor was detected</xcope>, whereas high level of progeny virions was produced, <xcope id="X1.6.2"><cue type="speculation" ref="X1.6.2">suggesting</cue> that this factor was <xcope id="X1.6.1"><cue type="negation" ref="X1.6.1">not</cue> required for viral replication</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
