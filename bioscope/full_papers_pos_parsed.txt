mining prokaryotic genomes for unknown amino acids  a stop codon based approach 
abstract 
background 
selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are the 21st and 22nd amino acids  which are genetically encoded by stop codons  
since a number of microbial genomes have been completely sequenced to date  it is tempting to ask whether the 23rd amino acid is left undiscovered in these genomes  
however  performance of the trna prediction program on an unknown trna family  which may have atypical sequence and structure  is unclear  thereby rendering their result inconclusive  
a protein level study will provide independent insight into the novel amino acid  
results 
assuming that the 23rd amino acid is also encoded by a stop codon  we systematically predicted proteins that contain stop codon encoded amino acids from 191 prokaryotic genomes  
since our prediction method relies only on the conservation patterns of primary sequences  it also provides an opportunity to search novel selenoproteins and other readthrough proteins  
it successfully recovered many of currently known selenoproteins and pyrrolysine proteins  
conclusion 
the method described here can be used in future studies to explore novel readthrough events from complete genomes  which are rapidly growing  
background 
two such amino acids have been discovered to date  selenocysteine 34 and pyrrolysine 56  
because each of them have specialized trna genes for decoding and can be considered extensions of the standard genetic code  they are called the 21st and 22nd amino acids  respectively  
selenocysteine  the 21st amino acid  is encoded by stop codon uga  and organisms that use selenocysteine have been found from all three domains of life  
its insertion into uga is directed by secis  selenocysteine insertion sequence  elements  a stem loop structure on the selenoprotein mrna  
along with the progress of genome sequencing projects  computational prediction methods of selenocysteine containing proteins  selenoproteins  have been developed by several research groups 78910  and the repertoire of selenoproteins has been greatly expanded 1112  
pyrrolysine  the 22nd amino acid encoded by stop codon uag  was recently discovered from a methanogenic archaea 56  
currently  only methanogenic archaea of the order methanosarcinales and one bacterium are considered to utilize pyrrolysine 13  
the limited phylogenetic distribution of pyrrolysine suggests that its incorporation into the genetic code of methanogen is relatively recent  and the insertion mechanism of a novel amino acid can evolve in a shorter period of time than anticipated  
this raises an interesting question     is there a 23rd amino acid     
if such an amino acid is discovered  it will deepen our understanding of the evolution and diversity of the genetic code  
because genome sequences of various prokaryotes are available today  there will be a chance to discover the novel amino acid via analysis of these genomes  
since both the 21st and 22nd amino acids are encoded by stop codons  the prime suspect is other stop codons  e g  stop codon uaa   although the possibility of sense codons certainly remains  
using this clue  computational screening methods of the 23rd amino acid can be designed  
recently  lobanov et al  addressed this problem by searching trnas with anticodons corresponding to stop codons 14  
they concluded that the 23rd amino acid would have a limited phylogenetic distribution  if it exists  
however  programs for trna identification are based on the features of known trnas and do not necessarily perform well on unknown ones  
there is another approach to searching for the 23rd amino acid  
by enumerating orfs that have an inframe stop codon from genomes and examining their evolutionary conservation  candidate proteins can be predicted  
because such an orf based study is independent from the trna analysis  it can either identify candidate organisms missed by the previous study or strengthen its negative conclusion  
here we report a comprehensive analysis of prokaryotic orfs that contain an inframe stop codon  
through enumeration of theoretical orfs and inspection of their evolutionary conservation  candidates of readthrough proteins were predicted  
they contained many of the known proteins with stop codon encoded amino acids  but almost no novel candidates were identified  
therefore  the unknown amino acid  if it is encoded by a stop codon  is unlikely to exist in the current databases of microbial genomes  
the consequences for selenoproteins and other readthrough genes are also discussed  
results 
basic ideas 
in this study  we focus on theoretical orfs with one inframe stop codon  termed  interrupted orfs   iorfs   figure 1a   
if we enumerate all iorfs from microbial genomes  most of the readthrough genes will be included in them  
however  the vast majority of the enumerated iorfs will be biologically meaningless  
to filter out such meaningless iorfs  we required the iorfs to have at least one homolog in other genomes  because evolutionary conservation of primary sequence is a strong indicator of functional importance  
the first problem is that even if an iorf has homologs in other species  it could be a pseudogene or a product of sequencing error  
the second problem is that adjacent genes on the same reading frame may satisfy the condition of conserved iorfs  
in particular  gene pairs within an operon are problematic because their gene arrangement is often conserved  
if the intergenic distance between two genes in an operon happens to be a multiple of three  they look like a conserved readthrough gene

 b  readthrough genes can be distinguished from two adjacent genes based on the results of blast searches  
boxes denote iorfs  and    indicates the inframe stop codon  
shaded regions represent actual protein coding regions  
if an iorf codes a readthrough protein  blast hits from other organisms will cover the inframe stop codon  
to discriminate them from true readthrough genes  evolutionary information was exploited  
in order to eliminate pseudogenes and sequencing errors  conservation of iorfs and their inframe stop codons was examined  
in this way  they can be eliminated as candidates  
a drawback of this criterion is that it limits the target of our study to readthrough genes conserved across two or more species  
to address the second problem  adjacent gene pairs were filtered out by examining boundaries of sequence alignments between iorfs and its homologs  figure 1b   
the stop codon encoded amino acids of prokaryotes are usually located inside domains  the units of evolutionary sequence conservation  
therefore  the aligned regions of readthrough proteins contain their inframe stop codon  
note that  however  if the whole length of an iorf was used as a query sequence  this procedure will erroneously discard multidomain readthrough proteins  
to avoid this problem  a partial sequence around the inframe stop codon was used as a query  
prediction procedure 
the prediction schema is shown in figure 2  
a total of 191 prokaryotes were analyzed in this study  of which 166 are bacteria and 25 are archaea  
they were selected from 328 prokaryotes with completely sequenced genomes by excluding closely related species  
from the genome sequences of the 191 organisms  all possible iorfs were enumerated  
two conditions were imposed on the geometry of the iorfs  figure 1a   
first  only iorfs longer than 80 codons were extracted  
secondly  margins between the inframe stop codon and both termini of the iorf must be longer than 10 codons  
the total number of iorfs extracted under these conditions was 2 969 958  
next  iorfs that overlap rna genes or protein coding genes in different reading frames were discarded  
this test significantly reduced the number of iorfs to 390 926

a flowchart of the prediction procedure  
several steps are omitted for simplicity  
detailed explanation is given in the text  
as noted above  the target of this study is evolutionarily conserved iorfs  
thus  it was examined whether the iorfs have homologous regions in other genomes  
the 390 926 iorfs were translated into amino acid sequences and subjected to tblastn 16 against the 191 genome sequences  
after the blast searches  iorfs that have at least one interspecific hit that contains the inframe stop codon were collected  
there were 94 690 iorfs that have interspecific hits  
the result of the above homology searches was also used for the boundary analysis  figure 1b   
a total of 26 003 iorf satisfied the above criteria  
to examine intrafamily conservation of the inframe stop codons  these iorfs were clustered into protein families based on sequence similarity  
after removal of singletons  679 clusters with two or more members were obtained  
a cluster was discarded unless all members of the cluster had the same type of inframe stop codons  uaa  uag or uga   
the locations of the inframe stop codons were also required to be identical in the multiple sequence alignment of the cluster members  
these conditions reduced the number of clusters to 273  
manual inspection of these 273 clusters revealed that they still contain many false positives that are unrelated to stop codon encoded amino acids  
hence  three step filtering procedures were applied to remove the false positives  
briefly  the first filter assesses protein likeliness based on the signal of purifying selection  while the second and third filters try to remove adjacent gene pairs using the pattern of blast alignments  for details  see materials and methods   
as a result of the filtering  the number of candidate clusters was reduced to 32  
through manual inspection of the blast alignments  11 clusters were discarded because they are highly unlikely to code readthrough proteins  
known proteins in the predicted clusters 
the clusters predicted by our method are summarized in table 1  
of the 21 clusters  15 were known selenoproteins  and four were known pyrrolysine proteins  
to assess the sensitivity of our method  the result was compared with a list of prokaryotic selenoproteins reported by kryukov and gladyshev 12  
since our target is readthrough genes conserved across two or more species  such selenoprotein families were selected from their list  
there were 15 families satisfying this criterion  but one family  proline reductase  was excluded because it was found in only one organism in our dataset  
of the 14 families  11 were found in our prediction result  
selw like protein was below the threshold of detection  because its stop codon is near the n terminus and the amino acid sequences of its members are too divergent  
since these two families are homologous  they were grouped into an identical cluster at the clustering stage of our method  
however  the positions of selenocysteine were different between the two families  figure 3   
to deal with a situation like this  a reexamination of the clustering threshold and subdivision of clusters will be required  
predicted clusters of readthrough proteins 
a plus sign in a locus indicates that the genomic coordinates of the iorf can be described by a concatenation of two genes or regions  
for example   gsu2293   downstream  means that the iorf consists of the gene gsu2293 and its downstream sequence  
selenocysteine residues of peroxiredoxin like protein families constitute homologous redox motifs  txxu and uxxc   but their positions are different between two families  
columns are colored according to sequence conservation  
selenocysteine residues are shown in red  and the other residues in the redox motifs are shown in yellow  
prx  peroxiredoxin  tpo  thiol protein disulphide oxidereductase  adeh  anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans  gmet  geobacter metallireducens  gsul  g  sulfurreducens  dpsy  desulfotalea psychrophila  
the alignments were computed using clustalw  and the figures were generated using jalview  
of the four pyrrolysine proteins detected  three methylamine methyltransferases have been experimentally confirmed to contain pyrrolysine 617  
the rest is a cluster of tetr like transcriptional regulators from methanosarcina acetivorans and m  barkeri  
since the genome annotation of m  acetivorans describes this protein as a gene containing an inframe amber codon  we classified it as a   known   candidate  although it is still unclear whether it really contains pyrrolysine  
they are a methlycobamide com methylase and four transposases 18  
this is unavoidable because of the inability of our method to detect species specific readthrough events  
it is the price for reliably excluding pseudogenes and sequencing errors  
unknown candidates in the predicted clusters 
therefore  unknown clusters in our candidates have possibilities for the 23rd amino acid or novel readthrough proteins  
there were two such clusters  table 1   
the first cluster is comprised of c type cytochromes from    proteobacteria geobacter sulfurreducens and g  metallireducens  
homology search against unfinished microbial genomes identified seven homologous proteins from four other    proteobacteria species  
multiple sequence alignment of these sequences is shown in figure 4a

the possible selenocysteine residues are shown in red  and putative heme binding motifs are underlined  
note that sequence conservation near the selenocysteine is comparable to that of the n terminal cytochrome domain  
a protein dpro_2 contains yet another inframe stop codon  tag  at the column 189  
it will be either a sequencing error or a pseudogene  
gsul  g  sulfurreducens  gmet  g  metallireducens  gura  g  uraniumreducens  gfrc  geobacter sp  frc 32  dace  desulfuromonas acetoxidans  dpro  delta proteobacterium mlms 1  
 b  hypothetical proteins from geobacter species  
the inframe stop codons  tag  are shown in red  
this cluster is probably an artifact of close phylogenetic relationship  
we expect that this cluster may represent a novel selenoprotein family  
high conservation of residues near the inframe stop codon also suggests the importance of this region  
therefore  yet another possibility is that they are a highly conserved operon  
an experimental verification is necessary to distinguish these two possibilities  
the second cluster consists of two hypothetical proteins  again from g  sulfurreducens and g  metallireducens  figure 4b   
this is because the residues near the inframe stop codons are poorly conserved  
moreover  the c terminal extensions are quite short  about 20 aa   
the sequence conservation in this region can be easily explained by the close phylogenetic relationship between the two species  
stop codon usage in the pre filtering clusters 
the above negative result could be explained if the filtering process  which is the final step of the prediction method  figure 2   was too strict  
although the raw output of the search for evolutionarily conserved iorfs was 273 clusters  most of them were discarded at the subsequent filtering stage  
this is practically indispensable for objective classification of candidates  but there is no guarantee that unknown proteins with the 23rd amino acid will score higher than the thresholds  
to explore whether a number of good candidates lie below the thresholds  the 273 clusters were analyzed in a way independent from filtering  
if an organism has many readthrough proteins  proteins from the organism will frequently appear in the 273 clusters  
moreover  relative usage of the inframe stop codons will deviate from that of usual termination signals in the proteome  
figure 5 shows the discrepancies between relative usage of the inframe and c terminal stop codons of 127 organisms in the pre filtering clusters  
only seven organisms had statistically significant discrepancies  p   0 05   and all of them are known to utilize selenocysteine or pyrrolysine

the inframe stop codon usage is taken from the pre filtering clusters  and the c terminal usage is computed based on the annotated proteins of the organism  
the organisms are ordered by their discrepancy scores  
the discrepancy score is the negative logarithm of a p value of fisher s exact test  
the dotted line indicates significance level 0 05 after a correction for multiple testing  
an inspection of the g  oxydans iorfs in the 273 clusters revealed that their inframe stop codons are dominated by taa  but all of them belong to a single protein cluster associated with transposable elements  
sensitivity of this test is not high because many organisms that utilize selenocysteine were below the defined threshold  
discussion 
as the number of completely sequenced genomes increases  several research groups started to predict proteins that contain stop codon encoded amino acids through computational analyses  
most of them are aimed at identification of selenoproteins  reflecting concerns from the scientific community and accumulated knowledge on selenocysteine  
in order to improve prediction specificity  they have fully exploited the known features of selenocysteine  such as the secis elements or cysteine homologs  which have cysteine in place of selenocysteine  
such general purpose algorithms have also been developed to date  
the method of chaudhuri and yeates 10 extracts iorfs from microbial genomes and analyzes sequence conservation around the inframe stop codon  
their method is thus similar to ours and applicable to both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine  
perrodou et al  19 constructed a database of predicted recoding events in microbes  
their method is applicable not only to stop codon readthrough but also to frameshift  
for instance  chaudhuri and yeates reported a homolog of cobalamin biosynthesis protein cobn as a novel candidate of pyrrolysine protein  
however  the gene is probably a pseudogene because it contains an inframe taa codon in addition to the tag codon  and only one species seems to have the amber containing form of the gene  
however  that is not necessarily true  
yet another example is glycine reductase selenoprotein a  
only the selenocysteine containing form of the enzyme is currently known 20  
if any non readthrough homologs are registered in public sequence databases  a careful annotation process of a newly sequenced genome will be able to detect readthrough genes  even though they may be annotated as pseudogenes  
however  if all members of a gene family have stop codon readthrough  correct annotation of their gene structure will be extremely difficult  and all of them will be split into two distinct genes  
using this method  a systematic screening of the 23rd amino acid and other readthrough genes was carried out  
many of the currently known selenoproteins and pyrrolysine proteins were recovered  indicating the effectiveness of this approach  
in particular  successful detection of pyrrolysine containing methyltransferases and selenoprotein a should be noted  
however  almost no novel candidates for readthrough genes were predicted  
what can be concluded from this result  
although a broad spectrum of taxonomic groups has been subjected to genome sequencing  the genomes of most microbial species on the earth have yet to be determined  
the unknown amino acid may be used by these species  
alternatively  only one organism in our dataset may have the 23rd amino acid  
this is because our method is limited to readthrough genes conserved across two or more species  
if the novel amino acid appears in younger  non conserved sequences  our technique will miss them  
in either case  the distribution of the 23rd amino acid will be significantly narrower than that of selenocysteine  which has scattered but wide distribution 21  
this conclusion coincides with and strengthens that of the previous research on trna 14  
it is well known that the genetic code varies in several organisms 22  
thus  certain organisms may use one of the sense codons for the novel amino acid  
because codons for most amino acids are degenerate  redefinition of one of them is feasible  
however  that possibility is beyond the scope of this study and is left as an open problem  
bioinformatics analysis of unusual trna genes and codon usage may provide insights into this problem  
in addition to the 23rd amino acid  our method can simultaneously explore selenoproteins and other readthrough proteins  
a common assumption in microbial selenoprotein predictions is that selenoproteins will have cysteine homologs  
our method can reassess this assumption in a secis independent way  
such selenoproteins identified through our screening of nearly 200 microbial genomes were selenoprotein a and only one uncertain candidate  
other readthrough proteins with canonical amino acids  i e   proteins that have canonical amino acids at their inframe stop codons  are quite rare in prokaryotes 1  
this is because our method assumes that stop codon encoded amino acid is located inside a domain  but it is unclear whether it holds true in prokaryotic readthrough with canonical amino acids  
what can be concluded from our result is that this type of readthrough will be located outside of domains  such as a linker between two domains  
such a stop codon may behave as a switch that regulates production of short and long isoforms from a single mrna  as in readthrough genes from viruses 24  
conclusion 
to explore the possibility of a 23rd amino acid  orfs in prokaryotic genomes were investigated in a comprehensive way  
therefore  if such an amino acid exists  it will have limited distribution in the tree of life  
alternatively  it may be encoded by one of the sense codons  
from the viewpoint of selenoprotein prediction  the sensitivity of our method was lower than an existing method  
however  our method has several unique features  
it is applicable to general readthrough genes and rigorously excludes pseudogenes and sequencing errors  
it will help in identification of novel readthrough genes from the rapidly expanding collection of complete microbial genomes  
methods 
enumeration of iorfs from prokaryotic genomes 
a total of 328 complete genome sequences of prokaryotes were downloaded from the kegg ftp site 25 in april 2006  
from them  191 representative organisms were selected by excluding close relatives  
the threshold was set to average sequence identity 90  of two house keeping genes  dna polymerase iii    subunit and alanyl trna synthetase  
from these 191 genomes  iorfs longer than 80 codons were enumerated using inhouse software  which is available from the author s web site 26  
both upstream and downstream regions of its inframe stop codon were required to be longer than 10 codons  
two stop codons of an iorf  i e  the inframe and c terminal stops  can be any combination of canonical stop codons  taa  tag  tga   
however  for mycoplasma  only taa and tag were used  
three codons atg  ttg and gtg were allowed to be start signals  
the iorfs of each organism were compared with protein coding genes of the organism using blastx  
similarly  iorfs were compared with rna genes using blastn  and those matched with the rnas were removed  
remaining iorfs were translated into amino acid sequences  
we translated all three types of nonsense codons into the one letter code u  so as to simplify visual inspection of sequence alignments  
although the code u is usually for selenocysteine  it will be harmless because u is automatically converted into    inside the blast programs  
construction of clusters of conserved iorfs 
to examine evolutionary conservation of the iorfs  a window of 101 residues around the inframe stop codon was extracted and subjected to tblastn searches against the above 191 genome sequences  
if there were any hits  e value   0 01  in other organisms  and if the hit includes 10 upstream and 10 downstream residues of the inframe stop codon  then the iorf was retained  
eligible iorfs were then clustered using blastclust with score density 0 5 and minimum length coverage 0 6  
after removing singleton clusters  multiple sequence alignments of the remaining clusters were computed using mafft 27 with the l ins i option  
subsequently  conservation of the inframe stop codons in each cluster was examined  
three step filtering of the candidate clusters 
the first filter examines protein likeliness of the iorfs  
this filter is mainly designed to remove conserved non coding sequences  cns  immediately downstream of non readthrough genes  
the dn ds was calculated for each of the two parts flanking the inframe stop codon in an iorf using codeml program in the paml package 28  
statistical significance was estimated by likelihood ratio test 29  
the observed alignment was fitted to two distinct substitution models  one of which estimates dn ds from the data  and the other fixes it to 1 0  
let lfree and lfix denote log likelihood of these models  
then  2  l   2 lfree     lfix  approximately follows the   2 distribution with one degree of freedom  
if dn ds was less than 1 0  and the statistics 2  l was larger than a threshold  we regard it as a sign of purifying selection  
in this study  the threshold was set to 5 0  corresponds to p   0 025  so that the known readthrough proteins score higher than the threshold  
for each of the above clusters  an all against all comparison of cluster members was performed  
if any pair exhibits such signals in both the n  and c terminal parts  the cluster was retained  
the second and third filtering processes remove such genes based on blast alignment patterns  
although the boundary analysis applied previously has the same goal  figure 1b   some gene pairs escaped elimination  
the second filter inspects synteny of iorfs  
if the n  and c terminal parts of an iorf have distinct but closely arranged blast hits in other genomes  it strongly suggests the iorf is actually two adjacent genes  
translated sequences of iorfs in the pre filtering clusters were subjected to tblastn searches against the genome database  
if both the best hits of the n  and c terminal parts are statistically significant  e value   10 5   and distance between them is less than 1 kbp  we call these hits  syntenic hits   
if any syntenic hits with non coinciding reading frames were found  the cluster was removed  
the third filter uses co occurrence of residues around the inframe stop codon as another source of information for screening stop codon readthrough  
suppose a window of 21 residues centered at the inframe stop codon  
in prokaryotes  most stop codon encoded amino acids are located inside a domain  the unit of evolutionary sequence conservation  
in contrast  if the iorf is actually two adjacent genes  then upstream and downstream residues of the stop codon will appear separately in many alignments  
we defined a co occurrence matrix as a 21    21 matrix whose  i j  th element represents how often residue i and j appeared simultaneously in n alignments  
the matrix elements were subsequently normalized to the number of alignments n  
by definition  the more often the upstream and downstream residues of the inframe stop codon co occur in the alignments  the higher the density in the upper right quarter of the matrix  
if average density in the quarter was lower than 0 85  the cluster was filtered out  
stop codon usage 
for each organism  its iorfs were extracted from the pre filtering clusters  and codon usage at the inframe stop positions was counted  
codon usage at the c terminal stop codons in its proteome was also computed using data of coding sequences downloaded from kegg genes 25  
these data were combined into a 3    2 matrix  and fisher s exact test was applied  
the p value was corrected for multiple testing using the bonferroni correction because there were 127 organisms in the pre filtering clusters  
probabilistic prediction and ranking of human protein protein interactions 
abstract 
background 
although the prediction of protein protein interactions has been extensively investigated for yeast  few such datasets exist for the far larger proteome in human  
furthermore  it has recently been estimated that the overall average false positive rate of available computational and high throughput experimental interaction datasets is as high as 90   
results 
the prediction of human protein protein interactions was investigated by combining orthogonal protein features within a probabilistic framework  
the features include co expression  orthology to known interacting proteins and the full bayesian combination of subcellular localization  co occurrence of domains and post translational modifications  
a novel scoring function for local network topology was also investigated  
this topology feature greatly enhanced the predictions and together with the full bayes combined features  made the largest contribution to the predictions  
a subset of the 32892 novel predicted interactions have been independently validated  
comparison of the prediction dataset to other available human interaction datasets estimates the false positive rate of the new method to be below 80  which is competitive with other methods  
since the new method scores and ranks all human protein pairs  smaller subsets of higher quality can be generated thus leading to even lower false positive prediction rates  
conclusion 
the set of interactions predicted in this work increases the coverage of the human interaction map and will help determine the highest confidence human interactions  
background 
protein protein interactions perform and regulate fundamental cellular processes  
the comprehensive study of such interactions on a genome wide scale will lead to a clearer understanding of diverse cellular processes and of the molecular mechanisms of disease  
although the determination of interactions by small scale laboratory techniques is impractical for a complete proteome on the grounds of cost and time  several experimental techniques now exist to determine protein protein interactions in a high throughput manner 1  
high throughput datasets have been generated for model organisms such as yeast 23456  worm 7 and fly 89 as well as escherichia coli 10  
in addition  the first broad focus experimental datasets for the human interactome have recently been published 1112  
interactions determined by high throughput methods are generally considered to be less reliable than those obtained by low throughput studies 1314 and as a consequence efforts are also underway to extract evidence for interactions from the literature 151617  
analysis of the high throughput datasets has shown that they overlap very little with each other  suggesting that their coverage is low  
indeed  it has been estimated recently that the current yeast and human protein interaction maps are only 50  and 10  complete  respectively 18  
the low coverage and variable quality of the experimental interaction datasets have prompted many groups to investigate computational methods to predict interactions or to determine the most likely interactions seen in the high throughput datasets  
the different approaches to predict interactions can be grouped into five main categories  
1  predictors based on sequence and structure exploit the observation that some pairs of sequence motifs  domains and structural families tend to interact preferentially  
some methods predict interaction from sequence motifs found to be over represented in interacting protein pairs 19  or by considering the physico chemical properties and the location of groups of amino acids in the sequence 2021  
others investigate the co occurrence in interacting proteins of specific protein domains or their structural family classification 2223  
when three dimensional structures are available for both proteins thought to interact  high quality predictions and additional information such as the residues involved in the interaction and their binding affinity may be estimated  reviewed in 24   
similarly  when two proteins show clear sequence similarity to proteins that exist in a complex for which the three dimensional structure is known  detailed predictions of the atomic level interactions may be made  
for example  the major complexes in yeast have been predicted by this strategy 25  
2  predictors based on comparative genomics have been exploited primarily in prokaryotes  
they consider the physical location of genes  as well as their pattern of occurrence and evolutionary rate  to predict interactions or functional relationships between protein pairs  
some predictors make use of the observation that neighboring genes whose relative location is conserved across several prokaryotic organisms are likely to interact 26  
other predictors exploit the observation that gene pairs that co occur in related species or that co evolve also tend to be more likely to interact 27282930  
in addition  domains that exist as separate proteins in some genomes but are also seen fused in a single protein in other genomes have been used to suggest the isolated domains may interact 3132  
3  predictors based on orthology work on the assumption that the orthologs of a protein pair that are known to interact in one organism will also interact  
such relationships are often referred to as interologs 33  
for example  at blast e values below 10 10  it has been shown that 16   30  of yeast interactions can be transferred to the worm 34 while further studies have estimated that a joint e value below 10 70 is required to transfer interactions reliably between organisms 35  
interologs have been used to predict protein protein interactions in human 36  
4  predictors based on functional features exploit non sequence information to infer interactions  
some predictors exploit the observation that there is a significant correlation in the expression levels of transcripts encoding proteins that interact 37  
since proteins must be co localized in order to interact  protein subcellular localization has often been used to assess the quality of interaction datasets 3839  
similarly  interacting proteins are also often involved in similar cellular processes  so gene ontology  process  and  function  annotations have been exploited to predict interactions and validate high throughput datasets 163638  
5  predictors have exploited similarities in the network topology of known interaction datasets to predict novel interactions  
in one study  the local topology of small world networks has been used to assess the quality of interaction datasets and predict novel interactions 40 while gerstein and colleagues have investigated the prediction of interactions by the identification of missing edges in almost fully connected complexes 41  
in addition to these diverse approaches  some groups have combined concepts from several of the above categories in integrative frameworks  
the first such predictor integrated co expression data  co essentiality as well as biological function in a na  ve bayes network to provide proteome wide de novo prediction of yeast protein interactions 37  
subsequently  the combination of many more diverse features was investigated using different frameworks to predict yeast protein protein interactions  increasing the prediction accuracy and allowing an assessment of the limits of genomic integration 424344  
the integration of diverse genomic features has also been useful in the investigation of the related but broader problem of predicting protein protein associations as well as complex and pathway membership  see for example 45   
although  many computational methods have investigated the prediction of protein protein interactions  few have so far been applied to the human proteome  
the first large scale prediction of the human interactome map involved transferring interactions from model organisms 36  
this resulted in over 70000 predicted physical interactions involving approximately 6200 human proteins  
a second method integrated expression data  orthology  protein domain data and functional annotations into a probabilistic framework and resulted in the prediction of nearly 40000 human protein interactions 46  
it has recently been estimated that the false positive rates of these computational datasets as well as of available high throughput human interaction datasets are  on average  as high as 90  and their coverage is only approximately 10   indicating that more such efforts are needed to increase the coverage and confidence we have in current maps of the human interactome 18  
in this paper  the prediction of physical interactions between human proteins has been investigated by integrating in a bayesian framework several different pieces of evidence including orthology  functional features and local network topology  
in order to increase the accuracy and coverage of the predictions  different types of negative data  non interacting protein pairs  were explored to train the predictor  
the most accurate of the predictors was then used to assess the likelihood of pair wise interaction for over 20000 human proteins from the ipi  international protein index  database  
these predictions provide a likelihood of interaction for over 260 million human protein pairs and lead to the prediction of over 37000 human interactions  
they should thus augment current knowledge of the human interactome as well as the understanding of the relationship between distinct cellular processes  
results and discussion 
architecture of the predictor and training of the modules 
the prediction of human protein protein interactions was investigated in a bayesian framework by considering combinations of individual protein features known to be indicative of interaction  
the seven individual features considered are summarized in table 1 and detailed in the methods section  
as indicated in table 1  the different features were grouped into five distinct modules  expression  e   orthology  o   combined  c   disorder  d  and transitive  t   
figure 1 illustrates the training scheme and architecture of the method  
the expression  orthology  combined and disorder modules can calculate likelihood ratios  lr  of interaction independently and are referred to as the group a modules  figure 1a   
the product of their likelihood ratios is referred to as the preliminary score  
the transitive module considers the local topology of the network predicted by the group a modules and thus requires the completion of their analysis to calculate its own likelihood ratios of interaction  figure 1b   
features considered in the prediction of interactions for each module 
architecture of the predictor and likelihoods of the modules 
architecture of the predictor and likelihoods of the modules  
the predictor consists of two different parts  a and b  which are trained consecutively  
the group a modules  shown in panel a  are trained in parallel  
the likelihood ratios  lr  for most of their states are shown in panel a  their complete likelihood ratios are available in additional file 4   
the product of the likelihood ratios of all group a modules considered in a given prediction is referred to as the preliminary score  ps  and can be calculated for all human protein pairs  
if the transitive module is considered  the local topology of the network determined by the assignment of preliminary scores to all protein pairs considered in the training set is used to calculate the likelihood ratios for the transitive module  shown in panel b  for every protein pair in the training set  
the final likelihood ratio is then the product of the preliminary score calculated in panel a and the likelihood ratio output by the transitive module in panel b  
for the orthology module  yl  ym  yh  yeast low  medium and high scoring bins  fl  fm  fh  fly low  medium and high scoring bins  wl  wm  wh  worm low  medium and high scoring bins  hm and hl  medium and low scoring bins for human protein pairs that have human paralogs    1 organism  bin for human protein pairs that have interologs in more than one organism  
for the combined module         refers to the lowest scoring bin  for the domain  dom   post translational modification  ptm  and subcellular localization  loc  features       refers to the second lowest scoring bin and            refer respectively to the third highest  second highest and highest scoring bins  
the likelihood ratios of interaction are evaluated for each module by considering the relative proportions of positive and negative training examples that have a specific state  i e  that fall in a particular bin of a module   
the datasets used to train the predictor consisted of 26896 known human protein interactions extracted from the human protein reference database  hprd  15 and approximately 100 times more randomly chosen protein pairs used as negative examples  
the composition of the datasets and likelihood ratio calculations are explained in greater detail in the methods section  
once the final likelihood ratio of interaction  lrfinal  is calculated for a given protein pair as shown in figure 1b  it is possible to estimate the posterior odds ratio of interaction by multiplying the final likelihood ratio by the prior odds ratio of interaction  
estimates for the prior odds ratio of interaction vary  
previous interaction studies on yeast and human use prior odds ratios that range from 1 600 to   1 400 37434647  
the evaluation of this ratio is difficult because not all true interactions are known  
as detailed in methods  the prior odds ratio for human protein interaction was explored by considering different versions and subsets of human interaction datasets  
this suggested that there is insufficient data currently available to determine a reliable ratio for human  
accordingly  we selected a prior odds ratio of interaction of 1 400 which is similar to current estimates for yeast and is probably still quite conservative  
thus  the likelihood ratio threshold to predict interactions is 400  
likelihood ratios of the modules 
figure 1 summarizes the likelihood ratios computed for the five modules  
the different modules differ in the range of likelihood ratio values achieved by their different states  
the orthology and combined modules both have states that achieve likelihood ratios above 400  as high as 1207 for the orthology module and 613 for the combined module   indicating that both these modules can  on their own  predict some interacting protein pairs with a posterior odds ratio above 1  
the expression module follows trends seen in previous studies with increasing likelihood ratios of interaction reflecting increasing expression correlation 3746  
similarly  but in a much more pronounced way  the disorder module is only slightly predictive of interaction  with a maximum likelihood ratio of 1 8  
most states of the orthology module achieve higher likelihood ratios than the highest obtained by the expression and disorder modules  
the direct transfer of interactions to human from either yeast  fly or worm does not alone result in a posterior odds ratio above 1  as the likelihood ratios of interaction for all yeast  fly and worm bins in the orthology module are below 400   
in contrast  the consideration of human interactions paralogous to the human protein pairs under investigation results in likelihood ratios of 431 and 1034  depending on how close the paralogs are as described in methods  which is much higher than those obtained for any single model organism  
this agrees with a recent report that suggested protein protein interactions are more conserved within species than across species 49  
the combined module uses domain co occurrence  post translational modification  ptm  co occurrence and subcellular localization information to predict interaction  
additionally  this combination circumvents possible problems of dependence between these features  
likelihood ratios of the features that form the combined module  considered separately 
likelihood ratios of the features that form the combined module  considered separately  
the combined module considers simultaneously three distinct features  the co occurrence of both domains and ptms as well as the subcellular co localization of proteins  
here the likelihood ratios of these features considered separately are shown  
in panel a  all domain pairs considered were given scores and likelihood ratios were estimated for different values of these scores  
similarly  shown in panel b are the likelihood ratios for different values of ptm co occurrence scores  
panel c shows the likelihood ratios for protein pairs localized to different sets of cellular compartments  
previous methods have investigated the use of co occurring domains to predict interaction  see for example 2346   
many pairs of domains co occur in proteins known to interact  
when investigated as a separate feature  the chi square score of co occurrence of domain pairs correlates well with the likelihood of interaction of protein pairs that contain these domains  with the highest chi square score bin obtaining a likelihood ratio of 14  as shown in figure 3a  
similarly  the co occurrence of ptms is also predictive of interaction  with its highest scoring bin obtaining a likelihood ratio of 6 as shown in figure 3b  
lists of high scoring domain pairs and ptm pairs are shown in additional files 1 and 2  
subcellular localization has been extensively used both to assess the quality of interaction datasets 115051 and to generate examples of non interacting protein pairs to use as negative datasets when training and testing predictors 3746  
in the present study  the use of localization was investigated as a feature predictive of interaction  
as shown in figure 3c  the likelihood ratio of same compartment protein pairs was found to be twice as high as that of randomly chosen or non annotated protein pairs whereas different non neighboring protein pairs are more than three times less likely to interact than random protein pairs  
individual localization features achieve low interaction likelihood ratios  
however  when integrated into the combined module  domain  ptm and localization information together achieve likelihood ratios that are high enough to predict interaction on their own  i e  above 400   
as expected  the highest likelihood ratio bins for the combined module are those representing the highest combinations of the three features separately  
the transitive module enhances the preliminary likelihood score  ps   calculated using the group a modules  by considering the local topology of the resulting network which is assessed using the neighborhood topology score as detailed in the methods section  
the likelihood ratios for different values of the neighborhood topology score are shown in figure 1b  
the transitive module is highly predictive of interaction and achieves likelihood ratios as high as 229  
however  it can predict interacting protein pairs with a posterior odds ratio above 1 0 when used in combination with any single module in group a  as the product of the highest likelihood ratios of the transitive module and any group a module is greater than 400 as can be seen from figure 1   
independence of the modules 
the final likelihood ratio output by the predictor is only representative of the true likelihood of interaction of a protein pair if the modules considered are independent  
conversely  some likelihood ratios would be underestimated for protein pairs achieving simultaneously low likelihoods for non independent features  
previous studies have demonstrated that some of the features considered here are indeed independent 43  
independence of all modules used in our predictor was verified by calculating pearson correlation coefficients for all pairs of modules  
as shown in table 2  all modules considered are independent  since the highest pearson correlation coefficients computed are well below any value considered significant  
pairwise pearson correlation for all modules 
accuracy of the predictors 
all combinations of modules were examined to determine which of the resulting predictors achieved the highest prediction accuracy  
in order to analyze the predictions  five fold cross validation experiments were performed and the area under partial roc  receiver operator characteristic  curves  partial aucs  measured  
roc50 and roc100 curves were selected as they consider a large enough number of positives to include all protein pairs predicted to have a posterior odds ratio above 1 0 by all the predictors investigated  
the area under all rocn curves considered is relatively low because of the high proportion of negatives with respect to positives in the training and test sets  100 1   
table 3 summarizes the characteristics of 19 different predictors and shows accuracy measures  
as more group a modules are considered within the same predictor  the rocn auc scores increase significantly  as would be expected since these features are independent  as shown in table 2  and thus contribute different information to the prediction  
for example  the predictor that considers both the expression and combined modules achieves a roc50 auc of 0 033 compared to 0 003 and 0 022 respectively for the individual modules  
for example  both the expression orthology predictor and the expression orthology disorder predictor achieve a roc50 auc of 0 024  
the disorder module offers the advantage of increasing the coverage of the prediction as a disorder score is calculated for all protein pairs  
prediction accuracy of different combinations of modules 
as the scores of the predictors increase  so do the number of interactions predicted above different posterior odds ratio thresholds  see lower portion of table 3   
for example  the expression orthology predictor achieves a roc50 auc of 0 024 and predicts 5670 interactions at a posterior odds ratio greater than 1 whereas the expression orthology combined predictor achieves a roc50 auc of 0 044 and predicts over 15000 interactions at a posterior odds ratio above 1  
the best combination of group a modules is the predictor consisting of the expression  orthology and combined modules  
the transitive module  which can only be used in combination with other modules  increases substantially the scores and number of interactions predicted  
the right hand portion of table 3 shows the accuracy measures for the highest scoring subset of predictors that consider the transitive module  
the transitive module enhances the prediction by identifying among protein pairs with a relatively high preliminary score those that are most likely to interact  by considering the local topology of the network around them  
for example  the roc50 auc rises from 0 044 to 0 075 when the transitive module is added to the expression orthology combined predictor  and the number of predictions above a posterior odds ratio of 1 doubles from 15330 to 34780  
the predictor that considers the expression  orthology  combined and transitive modules is the one that achieves the highest accuracy overall  
it is this predictor that is further analyzed in the next sections  
comparison to predictions generated using alternative training sets 
in this work training sets were used that comprised 100 times more negatives than positives  with the negatives randomly selected and filtered to remove any known or suspected positives  see methods   
other groups have used negative positive ratios ranging from 1 to more than 600  see for example 374752   
these issues have been investigated previously 53  
since the choice of negative training data may influence the method  the choice of different training sets in the context of the probabilistic predictor presented here was investigated to determine which type of training set offers the highest accuracy  
table 4 compares the accuracy of predictors trained with negative positive ratios of 1 100 and 1 1 and tested by five fold cross validation  
to perform such a comparison  the eoct predictor  expression  orthology  combined and transitive modules  was trained on datasets consisting of either equal numbers of positives and negatives or 100 times more negatives than positives and then tested on both types of datasets  
as shown in table 4  the predictors trained on datasets containing 100 times more negatives than positives perform significantly better than those trained on datasets containing equal numbers of positives and negatives  
for example  the 1 1 pos neg trained predictor achieves a roc50 auc of 0 0645 whereas its 1 100 pos neg trained counterpart achieves a 0 0747 roc50 auc  
this could be due to the fact that the number of non interacting protein pairs outweighs greatly the number of interacting protein pairs in cells  
it should be noted that predictors tested on datasets consisting of equal numbers of positives and negatives achieve much higher accuracy measures than those tested on datasets containing 100 times more negatives than positives  
this is because the number of positives scoring higher than the highest scoring n negatives  for a given value of n and a given predictor  will be greater if there are equal numbers of positives and negatives in the test set than if there are more negatives than positives  
influence of the negative positive training set ratio on the prediction accuracy 
the rocn aucs are an average of five separate experiments  each of which is itself a five fold cross validation experiment   
their standard deviation is shown in parenthesis  
a criticism of randomly chosen negatives is that they will contain some true interactors  
however  the set of interacting pairs in the full protein pair space is small and thus the contamination rate of randomly chosen negative datasets will in fact be very low  
contamination is probably below 1   which is likely lower than the contamination rate of the positive dataset as discussed in 47  
localization derived negatives  on the other hand  should be free of contamination  if the localization annotations are complete and accurate  both conditions that are difficult to obtain as discussed in 54  
in addition  proteins specific to a cellular compartment may have different characteristics to proteins in other compartments  
these issues have been discussed previously 52  
in order to see if different types of negatives could influence the accuracy of the predictors developed here we generated negative training test sets as in 46 by identifying all pairs of human proteins for which one protein is annotated as being nuclear and the other is annotated as being localized to the plasma membrane in the hprd database 15  
the localization derived negative trained predictor tested on sets containing localization derived negatives achieves a lower accuracy than that of the random negative trained predictor tested on a test set containing randomly generated negatives  0 0686     0 0010 vs 0 0747     0 0022   
our predictor trained with randomly generated negatives and a negative positive ratio of 100 performs the best out of all the combinations of training sets investigated  
it is this predictor that is further analyzed in subsequent sections  
contribution of the modules 
the relative contribution of the modules to the prediction of interaction was investigated in order to gain a better understanding of the predictive power and areas of highest usefulness of the different modules  
this set consists of 37606 distinct predicted interactions and is referred to as the lr400 dataset  all these interactions are listed and ranked in additional file 3   
these protein pairs represent the most probable interactors with respect to the features considered  among all protein pairs examined by the predictor  
to investigate the individual contribution of each module  we looked at the number of interactions predicted out of all lr400 pairs as a function of the minimum likelihood ratio of each module  
as shown in figure 4a  all modules contribute positively  i e  contribute a likelihood ratio greater than 1 0  to the prediction of a certain proportion of the interactions in the lr400 dataset  
the transitive module and to an even greater extent  the combined module contribute positively to the prediction of a very high proportion of the lr400 protein pairs  73  and 91  of the lr400 interactions have likelihood ratios greater than 1 for the transitive and combined modules respectively   
the transitive module provides a likelihood ratio of 91 for the prediction of over 70  of the lr400 interactions  
the combined module provides positive evidence for the highest number of interactions of the lr400 dataset  
however  the value of the likelihood ratio it contributes is below 20 for over 50  of protein pairs in the lr400 dataset  which means that for these protein pairs  the combined module must be used in combination with other modules to achieve a total likelihood ratio above 400   
the combined module does  however  achieve likelihood ratios high enough to predict over two thousand interactions of the lr400 dataset on its own  less than 15  of which are present in the training set  
the orthology module contributes to the prediction of only 8474 protein pairs in the lr400 dataset  23    
however  a large majority    75   of these 8474 predicted interactions achieve likelihood ratios above 200 from this module  
in fact  almost 40  of these lr400 interactions achieve a likelihood ratio above 400 from the orthology module  
this indicates that most interactions predicted by the orthology module  alone or in combination with other modules  are based on the highest scoring orthology bins  see figure 1a  which are the most conserved yeast interactions  whose bin achieves a likelihood ratio of 237   as well as human paralogous interactions and interactions found in more than one model organism  both of which achieve a likelihood well above 400   
few interactions in the lr400 dataset are predicted on the basis of having interacting orthologs in worm or fly alone  
the expression module provides positive evidence for a little less than half the predictions in the lr400 dataset  
contribution of the modules 
contribution of the modules  
to examine the contribution of the different modules  we plotted the number of interactions predicted among all lr400 interactions  all interactions predicted using the full predictor that obtain a likelihood ratio of interaction greater than 400  as a function of the minimum likelihood ratio of individual modules  in panel a  or of combinations of modules  in panel b   
in the case of combinations of modules  panel b   the minimum likelihood ratio is the product of the likelihood ratios of the modules considered  
thus for example  the product of the expression and orthology ratios is greater than 1 for almost 20000 lr400 interactions and greater than 10 for approximately 10000 lr400 interactions  dark blue diamonds in panel b   
e  expression module  o  orthology module  c  combined module  t  transitive module  
figure 4b summarizes the contributions of different combinations of modules  
the combined and transitive modules contribute the most to the prediction of interactions  
they alone can predict approximately 27000 of the 37606 interactions of the lr400 dataset  
when they are both present  regardless of which other modules are also present  they predict over 70  of the lr400 interactions  
in contrast  the two remaining modules  expression and orthology  can predict approximately 5000 interactions together  
this is interesting as many of the publicly available predicted interaction datasets mentioned in the background section use mainly orthology transfer from model organisms to identify interactions  
this is discussed further in the next section  
the curve representing the full predictor  consisting of the expression  orthology  combined and transitive modules  is also represented in figure 4b  the dark green squares   
by definition  it predicts all proteins in the lr400 dataset at likelihood ratios equal to or above 400  this is how the lr400 dataset was generated   
the right side of the curve illustrates the number of interactions that are predicted above likelihood ratios of 400 and more  
as shown in figure 4b  the full predictor predicts approximately 20000 interactions at a total likelihood ratio of 1600  which is equivalent to an estimated posterior odds ratio of 4   
at a likelihood ratio of 4000  approximately 11000 interactions are predicted and at a likelihood ratio of 8000  approximately 6500 interactions are predicted  
we verified that the increasing estimated posterior odds ratios translated into better predictive value  
figure 5 shows the true positive rate versus false positive rate for different posterior odds ratios as measured by five fold cross validation  
as the posterior odds ratio increases  the false positive rate decreases and the relative proportion of true positives increases when compared to the proportion of false positives  
accordingly  subsets of very high quality predictions may be generated by choosing a suitably high posterior odds ratio threshold  
true positive rate versus false positive rate for different estimated posterior odds ratios 
true positive rate versus false positive rate for different estimated posterior odds ratios  
the true positive rate  tpr  versus false positive rate  fpr  is plotted for different values of the posterior odds ratio estimated for the dataset by five fold cross validation  
as the posterior odds ratio increases  the false positive rate decreases and the ratio of the true positive rate divided by the false positive ratio increases  
thus  higher quality datasets can be generated by requiring higher posterior odds ratios  
the tpr is calculated as the number of true positives predicted divided by the total number of positives in the test set  
the fpr is calculated as the number of false positives predicted divided by the total number of negatives in the test set  
comparison to other interaction datasets 
the false positive rate  fpr  of our predictor was estimated by the method of d haeseleer and church 1855 and used to compare it to other prediction datasets  
the d haeseleer and church method compares two experimental datasets to a reference set and assumes that all intersections between the three datasets contain true positives  
it is thus possible to estimate the number of true positives predicted by an experimental dataset by comparing the number of interactions present in the different intersections of the two experimental methods and the reference dataset  for details  see 1855   
here  we compare three human interaction prediction datasets  the rhodes probabilistic dataset 46  the lehner orthology derived dataset 36 and the most accurate of our predictors  the lr400 subset of the predictor considering the expression  orthology  combined and transitive modules   
the rates estimated for the rhodes and lehner datasets are similar to previous estimates 18  
the estimated false positive rates for the lr400  rhodes and core lehner are quite similar  an average of 76  fpr for both the lr400 and core lehner datasets and 78  for the rhodes dataset  and well below the overall average false positive rate of 90  estimated for most available human high throughput experimental and prediction interaction datasets 18  
however  not all proteins encoded by a single gene will necessarily interact with all protein products encoded by a second gene  even if one such protein pair does  
this is why we describe interactions as a relationship between two proteins  allowing for a more precise description of the interaction  
to compare our predictions to these datasets  we consider that two genes interact if at least one of their respective protein products interact  
comparison to other interaction datasets 
comparison to other interaction datasets  
the false positive rates shown in panel a were estimated for the lr400 dataset as well as the rhodes  46  and lehner  36  predictions using the method described in  18  55  by comparing them two by two to a reference dataset  
the number and overlap of distinct proteins  shown in b  and distinct interactions  shown in c  are shown for the lr400 dataset  the rhodes prediction dataset and the june 2006 version of the hprd  
in figure 6b and 6c  we compare the number of distinct proteins and distinct interactions of the lr400 dataset to those of the rhodes prediction dataset and the june 2006 version of the hprd which was used to train our predictor  
the rhodes dataset was trained using an earlier version of the hprd  
as can be seen in figure 6  the intersections between the three datasets considered are low  especially when comparing the interactions  
as suggested in 18  by making more such datasets available  it will be possible to increase our coverage of the interaction space and determine the most likely human interactions  
another human interaction dataset has recently become available  the intnetdb 56  
it was generated by integrating seven different features  four of which involve transferring interactions or characteristics of protein pairs from model organisms to human  in a probabilistic framework  
interactions were predicted above a tp fp ratio  number of true positives divided by the number of false positives in the test set  of 1  
using such a threshold  the authors claim to predict 180 010 human interactions  
depending on the positive to negative ratio used in the datasets  tp fp   1 might correspond to an average posterior odds ratio of 1  
in contrast  the average posterior odds ratio of our lr400 dataset is above 700  
in comparison  by using a threshold of tp fp   1 in our test set  we predict over 1 000 000 human interactions  
independent validation 
as shown in figure 7  while less than 3  of the protein pairs predicted to interact at posterior odds ratios between 1 and 2 overlap with the hprd dataset used for training  this value increases to over 50  for the highest scoring subsets of the lr400 dataset  
these highest scoring predictions receive high likelihood ratios of interaction from all four predictive modules and represent the strongest examples of interaction as evaluated by our predictor  
such examples include interactions that allow the formation of well known protein complexes such as the proteasome  the mcm protein complex involved in the initiation of genome replication  replication factor c  the tbp taf complex  tbp associated factors  and the eif complex  eukaryotic translation initiation factors   
the highest scoring predictions in the lr400 dataset thus mainly represent interactions present in the hprd dataset as well as interactions between proteins that have strong sequence identity to these known interacting pairs  
however  as the posterior odds ratio decreases  the overlap between the predictions and the hprd derived training set decreases  
some subsets of quite high posterior odds have much smaller overlaps with the training set  
for example  interactions predicted at posterior odds ratios between 128 and 2048 have a 20 to 30  overlap with the training set as shown in figure 7  
five such validated predictions are reported here  
overlap of different subsets of the lr400 dataset with the hprd derived training set 
overlap of different subsets of the lr400 dataset with the hprd derived training set  
the number of interactions predicted and the proportion of overlap with the training set  which was derived from the hprd  were calculated for subsets of the lr400 dataset of different posterior odds ratios  
 tcptp was predicted to interact with stat6 at a posterior odds ratio of 4300  
it has been recently reported that tcptp  the only protein tyrosine phosphatase known to localize to the nucleus  dephosphorylates stat6 in this cellular compartment  which may in turn lead to the suppression of interleukine 4  il 4  induced signaling 57  
 n wasp and arp3 achieve a predicted posterior odds ratio of interaction of 2700  
a recent report suggested that the iqgap1 protein can activate n wasp thus changing its conformation and allowing it to bind the arp2 3 complex  which in turn directs the generation of branched actin filaments required for the extension of a lamellipodium 58  
 the vamp3 vti1a interaction was predicted with a posterior odds ratio of 1518  
both these proteins are believed to be part of the snare  soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor  family of proteins which are involved in membrane fusion events  
vti1a is a trans golgi network localized putative t snare 59 and vamp3 is an early recycling endosomal v snare 60  
these two proteins were recently shown to interact  leading to their functional implication in the post golgi retrograde transport step 61  
 cdk2 and mcm4 were predicted to interact at a posterior odds ratio of 62  
cdk2 has recently been shown to phosphorylate mcm4  a subunit of a putative replicative helicase essential for dna replication  on two distinct residues  leading to a change in its affinity to chromatin and its enrichment in the nucleolus 62  
 sam68 and smad2 achieve a predicted posterior odds ratio of 32  
this interaction has been experimentally demonstrated by large scale yeast two hybrid analysis of the smad signaling system 63  
our probabilistic predictor therefore not only reproduces and completes well known protein complexes but also identifies novel interactions  a subset of which have been independently validated  
conclusion 
the current human protein interaction map is estimated to be only 10  complete 18  
here  we investigated the prediction of human protein protein interactions in an effort to increase the coverage of the human interactome while simultaneously providing high quality predictions  
our investigation led us to compare the influence of different training sets on the prediction accuracy  
the use of randomly generated negative training examples and large negative to positive ratios in the training set generated the most accurate predictors in the context of our model  
a comparison to other large human interaction datasets revealed the average false positive rate of our dataset to be 76   which is much lower than the overall average for most large scale  currently available  human interaction datasets  experimental and computational  estimated to be 90  18  
a subset of our novel predictions have been independently validated by identifying recent reports that experimentally investigated and confirmed that these protein pairs do interact  
we provide all our predictions ranked according to the posterior odds ratio of interaction in additional file 3  
it is thus possible to restrict the dataset to the highest scoring protein pairs  and only choose for example  protein pairs that have an estimated true positive rate of interaction above 90    
by making this human interaction prediction dataset publicly available  it is our hope that it will help to identify the most high confidence interactions  leading to a more complete and accurate human interaction map  
methods 
datasets 
in order to investigate the likelihood of interaction of human proteins  62322 human protein sequences were downloaded from the international protein index  ipi  database  version 3 16  64  
some of these proteins are alternative transcripts of the same gene but can have distinct interaction partners  
known interactions were downloaded from the human protein reference database  hprd  june 2006 version  15  
this resulted in 26896 distinct human protein interactions involving 7531 distinct human proteins present in the initial ipi dataset  
the 26896 interactions from the june 2006 version of the hprd were used as the positive dataset in the training testing of the predictor  
two different sets of non interacting protein pairs were investigated  the main analysis employed a randomly generated negative dataset but this was also compared to a localization derived negative dataset  
both non interacting protein datasets were cleaned by removing all protein pairs that came from the positive dataset as well as protein pairs that were annotated as interacting in other databases  dip 65  679 interactions  bind 66  2650 interactions   or predicted to interact in other studies  ophid 67  21815 interactions   
of the 62322 human proteins from the initial ipi dataset  22889 were characterized by at least one of the features that we considered to predict interaction  see the features section   
these 22889 human proteins are encoded by 16904 distinct genes and are referred to as the informative protein set  
the randomly generated negative dataset used for the training and testing of the predictor was created by selecting protein pairs at random from the informative protein set  
in contrast  the localization derived negative dataset was created by selecting protein pairs from the informative protein set for which the hprd 15 annotates one as being primarily in the plasma membrane and the other as primarily in the nucleus  
training and testing was performed with 5 fold cross validation  
in addition  positive to negative ratios of 1 1 and 1 100 were considered  
the predictions were compared to the literature mined ramani dataset 16  the orthology derived lehner prediction dataset 36 and the probabilistic rhodes prediction dataset 46  
all three datasets identify the interactions by stating the names and or gene locus ids of the genes that encode the interacting proteins  
in contrast  we work directly on the protein sequences and so related the gene annotations to our protein identifiers by extracting entrez gene ids corresponding to the ipi protein entries from the ipi cross reference files  for the ipi release 3 24  64  
ensembl gene identifiers  ensembl 42  were also matched to entrez locus ids  ncbi36  using biomart 68  
despite this  37714 gene gene interactions were recovered from the rhodes dataset and 6132 interactions from the ramani dataset as well as 64306 and 10454 interactions from the lehner full and core datasets respectively  
learning method 
semi na  ve bayes classifiers were used to measure the likelihood of interaction of two proteins given the presence of the features considered  
this learning method was chosen because it allows the integration of highly heterogeneous data in a model that is easy to interpret and that can readily accommodate missing data  
the transparency of the method allows the straightforward determination of which features are most predictive of interaction at the level of the whole proteome as well as for individual protein pairs  
the prediction of protein interaction is a binary problem which can be expressed in bayesian formalism  
we are interested in determining the posterior odds ratio of interaction of two proteins  given the presence of the features we are considering  
this posterior odds ratio can be re written using bayes rule  opost   p i f1       fn p  i f1       fn  p f1       fn i    p i p f1       fn p f1       fn  i    p  i p f1       fn  p f1       fn i    p i p f       fn  i   p  i  p i p  i   p f1       fn i p f1       fn  i  oprior   lr 1     fn  where i is a binary variable representing interaction   i represents non interaction  f1 through fn are the features we are considering  oprior is the prior odds ratio and lr is the likelihood ratio  
if the features considered are independent  the likelihood ratio lr can be calculated as the product of the individual likelihood ratios with respect to the features considered separately  
in the independent case  the likelihood ratio can be calculated as  lr f1     fn   p f1       fn i p f1       fn  i      i 1n p fi i p fi i   
the likelihood ratios for the different features considered can be estimated by evaluating the ratio of the proportion of interacting and non interacting proteins for which a particular state of the feature is true in the training set  i e  by determining to which bin of the feature the protein pair belongs  for every protein pair in the positive and negative training sets   
more precisely  the training step consisted of calculating the respective proportions of positive and negative examples that fall into each bin of the feature s  considered  i e  that have a particular state   
the likelihood ratio of interaction for a given state is simply the ratio of the proportion of all positives that have that state divided by the proportion of all negatives that have that same state  
when a particular state of a feature occurs only in positive examples  known interacting proteins   the likelihoods are set to the highest non infinite value of any state for that feature  to avoid infinite values   
for a detailed calculation of the likelihoods see additional file 4  
prior odds ratio estimate 
this subset of interactions contains 36466 distinct interactions involving 5202 distinct proteins  thus resulting in a prior odds ratio of 1 370  
this is most likely a conservative estimate since a certain proportion of interactions remain unknown and so when more data become available  the prior odds ratio will increase  
for human proteins  12191 distinct interactions were recovered  involving 5164 human proteins from the september 2005 version of the hprd 15 and 26896 distinct interactions involving 7531 human proteins from the june 2006 version  leading respectively to prior odds estimates of 1 1093 and 1 1053  
however  taking the subset of 5164 proteins from the september 2005 version that are seen in the june 2006 version  20842 distinct interactions   gave a prior odds of interaction estimate of 1 639  
thus  between the two releases of the hprd  there was a large increase in the number of interactions for this subset of proteins and this is likely to continue for at least the next few releases  
as a consequence  a prior odds ratio of 1 400 was used for all work in the paper  which is similar to the estimate for yeast and is likely still an underestimate of the true value  
features 
seven distinct features combined into five modules were investigated as summarized in table 1 and described below  
1  
expression module 
expression data were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus 70  
the gds596 dataset was used which examines gene expression profiles from 79 physiologically normal tissues obtained from various sources 71  
expression data were recovered for 10642 distinct transcripts in 158 different arrays  2 arrays per tissue   
pearson correlations were calculated for all 56620761 transcript pairs and correlation values were grouped into 20 bins of increasing co expression  
2  
orthology module 
orthology maps between human and yeast  worm and fly were downloaded from the inparanoid database 72  
interaction datasets for model organisms were downloaded from the bind 66  dip 65 and grid 69 databases  
orthology interaction data were classified into 13 bins  
high  medium and low confidence bins were defined for human protein pairs that have interacting orthologs in either yeast  fly or worm  for a total of 9 bins   
the high confidence bins were populated by human protein pairs that have interacting orthologs that both achieve an inparanoid score of 1  i e  both proteins involved in an interaction in another organism are respectively the best orthology match for the two human proteins under consideration   
the medium confidence bins were populated by human protein pairs that have interacting orthologs but only one of the interacting orthologs has an inparanoid score of 1  
the orthology module has four additional bins  two bin for human pairs that have interacting paralogs in human  a medium and a low confidence bin which use the same definition as above for the model organisms   one bin for human pairs that have interacting homologs in more than one organism  these can be orthologs in yeast  worm or fly  or paralogs in human  and one bin for human pairs that have only non interacting orthologs  
3  
combined module 
this module incorporates three distinct features in a non na  ve bayesian framework  subcellular localization  domain co occurrence and post translational modification co occurrence  
subcellular localization 
neighboring compartments were chosen as compartment pairs sharing a high proportion of proteins  as investigated previously 54  
co occurrence of domains 
the chi square test was used as a measure of the likelihood of co occurrence of specific interpro domains and motifs 73 in protein pairs  
chi square scores were calculated for all pairs of domains motifs that occurred in the training data and were then grouped into 5 bins of increasing value  
additionally  pfam 74 domain pairs known to interact from three dimensional structures 75 were included in the highest chi square score bin  
when protein pairs contained more than one domain pair  the domain pair assigned to the highest chi square score bin was used to assign a likelihood of interaction  
post translational modification  ptm  pair co occurrence 
likelihoods were assessed using a ptm pair enrichment score calculated as the probability of co occurrence of two specific ptms in all pairs of interacting protein pairs divided by the probability of occurrence of both of these ptms separately  ptm_score p ptm i  ptm j  i p ptm i  i    p ptm j  i  where ptm i  and ptm j  are distinct ptms and i is the set of all interacting proteins that were used to train the predictor  
the annotations of ptms in human proteins were downloaded from uniprot 76 and hprd 15  
ptm instances described as  predicted    probable  or  possible  were excluded  leaving 3439 distinct proteins with ptm annotations in the training set  
the ptm pair enrichment scores were grouped into 4 bins of increasing value  
the localization  co occurrence of domains  and ptms were considered simultaneously to measure their predictive power in assessing the likelihood of protein interaction  
to do this  all possible combinations of the 4 localization bins  5 chi square domain co occurrence bins and 4 ptm_score bins were investigated and are referred to as the combined module  
4  
disorder module 
it has been suggested that unstructured regions of proteins are often involved in binding interactions  particularly in the case of transient interactions 77  
protein intrinsic disorder was predicted for all proteins considered by using the vsl2b predictor 78  
the disorder score for protein pairs was then calculated as the sum of percent disorder for each protein of the pair  
disorder scores were grouped into 6 bins of increasing value  
the expression  orthology  combined and disorder modules are referred collectively as the group a modules  
likelihood ratios for each of the group a modules are illustrated in figure 1a  see additional file 4 for complete likelihood ratios for every possible state of these modules and for detailed calculations of these likelihood ratios   
5  
transitive module 
the transitive module works on the premise that a pair of proteins is more likely to interact if it shares interacting partners  
it does this by considering the local topology of the network predicted by the integration of the group a modules as depicted in figure 2  
thus  the transitive module takes as input the product of the likelihood ratios of all other modules considered by the predictor  as illustrated in figure 1b   
for each pair of proteins in the training set  the product of the likelihood ratios from all other modules  referred to as the preliminary score  ps  in figure 1  was calculated for all protein pairs neighboring the pair  i e  all protein pairs which involve one protein from the initial protein pair under study and for which it is possible to calculate such a score   
all preliminary scores above 10 were kept  
this parameter was determined empirically  
a neighborhood topology score t was then calculated as follows  
transitive module hypothesis 
transitive module hypothesis  
t    e   ecse1  ei ec   ej ec  where ec is the set of edges that connect proteins i and j to their common interactors  ei is the set of edges that involve protein i  se is the score  likelihood ratio  of edge e and ei ec refers to the set difference of ei and ec  
for a given set of neighbors  t increases as the interactions with these neighbors become more likely  as the sum of se increases   
additionally  the topology score t of a pair of proteins increases as the proportion of likely interactors that these two proteins share increases  
the topology scores were grouped into 5 bins of increasing value  
it only considers the preliminary scores of its neighbors and so is truly based on the local network topology around that protein pair  
accordingly  the likelihood ratio the transitive module outputs for a given protein pair is independent of the likelihood ratio calculated by the group a modules for this same protein pair  
correlation analysis 
the pearson correlation between pairs of modules was estimated by taking 150 samples of 10000 protein pairs each and calculating the pearson correlation of the likelihood ratios for the two modules considered  for each sample  
the reported correlation values are the average of the 150 experiments  
accuracy measurements 
the accuracy of the predictors was measured by performing five fold cross validation experiments in which the datasets were randomly divided into five non overlapping sets  four of which were used to train the predictor while the fifth was used to test the prediction accuracy  
the accuracy reported is the average measured for all combinations of training and testing sets using these five sets  
testing was done by predicting the total likelihood scores for all protein pairs in the test set using the models computed in the training phase and then counting the number of pairs that were well predicted  
we used the area under partial roc curves as a measure of accuracy  
receiver operator characteristic  roc  curves plot the true positive rate versus the false positive rate over their full range of possible values  
in some circumstances  it is more informative to use partial roc curves  rocn curves  which illustrate the number of true positives identified by the predictor that score higher than the n highest scoring negatives  plotted for all values from 0 to n  
there are many more negatives than positives in our datasets and this is also thought to be true for the full protein interaction networks we are modeling  
since the aim is to identify the largest number of true interacting pairs while leaving out as many non interacting pairs as possible  it is most informative to measure the performance of the predictor under conditions of very low false positive rates  
accordingly  roc50 and roc100 curves were analyzed because given the size of the datasets  these curves consider all the protein pairs predicted to have a posterior odds ratio above 1 0  for all the predictors investigated  
the area under roc curves is often used as a summary measure of accuracy  
for rocn curves  it can be calculated as auc rocn   1nt       i 1nti  where i takes on values from 1 to n  t is the total number of positives in the test set and ti is the number of positives that score higher than the ith highest scoring negative  
a novel ensemble learning method for de novo computational identification of dna binding sites 
abstract 
background 
despite the diversity of motif representations and search algorithms  the de novo computational identification of transcription factor binding sites remains constrained by the limited accuracy of existing algorithms and the need for user specified input parameters that describe the motif being sought  
results 
we present a novel ensemble learning method  scope  that is based on the assumption that transcription factor binding sites belong to one of three broad classes of motifs   non degenerate  degenerate and gapped motifs  
scope employs a unified scoring metric to combine the results from three motif finding algorithms each aimed at the discovery of one of these classes of motifs  
we found that scope s performance on 78 experimentally characterized regulons from four species was a substantial and statistically significant improvement over that of its component algorithms  
scope outperformed a broad range of existing motif discovery algorithms on the same dataset by a statistically significant margin  
conclusion 
scope demonstrates that combining multiple  focused motif discovery algorithms can provide a significant gain in performance  
a user friendly web interface  java source code and executables are available at http   genie dartmouth edu scope  
backgound 
the computational discovery of dna binding sites for previously uncharacterized transcription factors in groups of co regulated genes is a well studied problem with a great deal of practical relevance to the biologist  since such binding sites provide targets for mutational analyses  for reviews see 123   
the position specific variability of transcription factor binding sites makes their de novo identification challenging  
many computational motif finding methods are based on the observation that transcription factor binding sites occur more often than expected by chance in the upstream regions of the set of genes regulated by the same transcription factor 1  
the problem thus simplifies to the identification of overrepresented motifs in a given set of upstream sequences  
motif finding programs rely on a search algorithm to optimize a motif model  an abstract representation of a set of transcription factor binding sites   
most recent programs represent motifs as position weight matrices  pwms   which record the frequency of each base at every position in the motif  
other motif finding programs have relied on the use of consensus motif models  in which every base is represented by a letter of the 15 letter iupac code  which accounts for degeneracies as well as single bases  or k mismatch motif models  in which a non degenerate word with at most k allowed mismatches is used to represent the word   
regardless of the motif model used  a search for all overrepresented motifs of any length and degree of degeneracy leads to a dauntingly large search space  
thus  motif finding algorithms restrict their search space by using simplified motif representations  employing heuristic search strategies that are prone to local optima  or invoking additional parameters to limit the search space and thereby pass some of the optimization process off to the user 3  
selection of the correct settings for these parameters is a crucial step in motif finding  and is often assumed to be the domain of experts  
in a recent evaluation  hu and colleagues 4 compared the performance of five motif finders on a single prokaryotic genome  systematically exploring the effects of nuisance parameters  including expected motif length and number of occurrences  
every motif finder they tested was found to be sensitive to values used for these parameters  
even assuming that optimal parameter settings exist for a motif finding program for each specific situation  for the typical biologist looking to identify motifs in a set of uncharacterized sequences  acquiring such expertise is an onerous task  
nuisance parameters complicate the interpretation of performance comparisons as well  
a recent large scale performance comparison between thirteen different motif finding tools used expert knowledge in setting the parameters for every program 5  
several of the programs contributing to the performance comparison were run with different parameter settings for each regulon  and in some cases  motifs were hand filtered as a post processing step  
such performance comparisons evaluate not just algorithms but also the expertise of the users  making it difficult for a first time user to select a motif finder on a principled basis  
a key result of the tompa  et al  study was the finding that all of the motif finders had roughly the same average performance under a wide range of conditions and test statistics 5  
this finding was particularly notable because the motif finders studied employed a wide range of motif representations  scoring functions and search strategies and all were operated under the most favorable conditions possible  
although the average performance of the programs did not differ significantly  the authors found that  for each pair of programs  each program performed better than the other on some subset of the data 5  
this diversity of performance has led a number of authors to speculate that ensemble methods  comprising multiple motif finders  may lead to improvements in accuracy 158  
ensemble methods  well known in the machine learning community 9  are typically composed of multiple methods comprising different search strategies  or the same search strategies with different initiation settings or random restarts  with a unified objective function  
the final predictions are chosen from the ensemble of methods by a learning rule  which may be as simple as finding the maximum score from all the methods  or as complex as optimizing a weighted scoring scheme from among the methods  
the construction of this learning rule is key to the performance of an ensemble learning method  as the performance of an ensemble method with an ineffective learning rule will be the average of the performance of its component algorithms  
this observation serves to illustrate the challenges to the construction of an effective learning rule  
to the best of our knowledge  only one study to date has explored ensemble learning in motif finding  
hu  li and kihara 4 described a simple ensemble method wherein the component programs were random restarts of the same stochastic algorithm  such as gibbs sampling or expectation maximization  and the learning rule was a voting scheme in which the results of each random restart cast a  vote  for which positions in the dna sequence should be part of the final reported motif  hereafter  we refer to this as the hlk method   
under this scheme  the authors found that ensemble learning resulted in an increase in performance ranging from 6 to 45   
the hlk voting method provides a framework wherein a number of different motifs finders can be combined under the heuristic that if several motif finders make the same  or overlapping  prediction  then that prediction is accurate  
here we present a novel ensemble motif finder based on a different conceptual approach  
thus  our ensemble uses three specialized algorithms whose search spaces restrict them to each of these three local optima  beam for non degenerate motifs  prism for degenerate motifs and spacer for bipartite motifs   
the results of these component algorithms are then combined using a learning rule that is simply the maximum score returned by each component algorithm  
to make comparisons possible  the motif scores returned by each algorithm are penalized according to the complexity of the motif  
in addition  we find that scope performs favorably compared to a diverse range of existing methods and is robust to the presence of extraneous sequences in its input  
results 
algorithm 
scope takes as input a set of sequences u that are upstream of a set of genes g that are thought to be coregulated  
the ultimate goal of a motif finder is to identify the specific subsequences    in u that act as binding sites for the transcription factor s  that regulate g  
in practice  sets of binding sites are represented using a motif  
we have found that simple consensus motifs over the full iupac alphabet  a 15 letter code consisting of the bases a t c g and all possible combinations  provide enough representational power to adequately describe     while still allowing for an efficient search 34  
scope has three component algorithms  beam  prism and spacer  which search for non degenerate  short degenerate  and long  highly degenerate and  gapped  motifs  respectively  figure 1   
each motif is scored considering one or both strands and the motif is marked to indicate which calculation scores higher  
the results of the three algorithms are merged and sorted  
artifactual motifs  whose significance can be accounted for by higher scoring motifs that they overlap  are identified and removed  for details  see additional file 1  section s1   
flow diagram for scope 
flow diagram for scope  
beam and spacer are run independently  prism runs on the top 100 motifs output by beam  
for yeast  whose upstream regions are standardized to 800 bp   beam and prism use the overrepresentation ks objective function  so ks   while spacer s slower running time requires the simpler overrepresentation objective function  so   
the top 5 motifs from spacer are rescored using the combined objective function  
the results of each program are sorted by sig and lower scoring motifs that substantially overlap higher scoring motifs are removed  
the filtered lists of motifs from the three programs are finally merged by sig score  
repetitive motifs are identified and removed during all stages  
each of scope s three component algorithms seeks to maximize the same objective function over a different class of motifs  
let m be a random variable over the full space of iupac words  
the statistical significance p m   m  of a particular word m is determined by the distribution of m over the entire space of upstream sequences in the given species  
in general  we seek to maximize  log p m   m    
for example  it is quite likely that there exists an extremely long sequence that is entirely unique to u  
such a unique sequence would appear to be highly significant  until we consider that we have in effect searched all possible sequences until we found one that is unique  
to correct for this multiple hypothesis testing problem  van helden et al  14 proposed using a bonferroni correction  in which p m   m  is penalized by the number of motifs n of length  m   
sig    log p m   m   n   
thus  if m    acgt   n   44  
we employed this same definition of sig for beam  our algorithm that searches for non degenerate motifs 10  
defining n for degenerate or bipartite motifs raises a significant conceptual challenge  
van helden et al  14 chose to use the same definition  but limited their search to a small number of degenerate bases  
building on this intuition  one can argue that the characters   a   and   not a    iupac character   b    are roughly equivalent  while   a or g    iupac character   r    is different from   a   as there are six ways to define a combination of two bases  while only four ways to define a combination of one base or three bases  
for motif m   m1m2   mn  we can therefore define n       choose 4   mi    where  mi  is the number of dna bases covered by the iupac character mi  
in the case were both orientations of the motif are considered  this number is adjusted to account for palindromes  
the resulting sig score thus penalizes motifs based on their length and degeneracy  enabling fair comparisons to be made between different motif classes  
testing 
evaluation of objective functions used by scope 
each component algorithm in scope efficiently searches its restricted search space  keeping scope s runtime low  average runtime on our datasets were about one minute   
this efficiency allowed us to explore several objective functions for scoring the statistical significance p m   m  of motifs  
these objective functions were as follows  position bias  based on the kolmogorov smirnov  or ks  statistic   overrepresentation  a poisson based measure based on how often a motif occurs in u  and coverage  a poisson based measure based on how many upstream sequences contain the motif   
for precise definitions  see methods  
to establish which objective function  or combination of functions  was most suitable  we tested each objective function independently of scope  using a subset of the s  cerevisiae dataset  
the measure used to assess the biological relevance of a motif was accuracy  a measure of the nucleotide level overlap between a motif and the known binding sites  for details see methods   
from each regulon from the scpd database 15 we selected ten six mers at random from the upstream sequences and ten six mers at random from the collection of known binding sites for that regulon  
for each of these sampled six mers  we calculated accuracy with respect to the known binding sites  
we also calculated the sig score for each six mer  using four objective functions  ks  overrepresentation  coverage and combined ks overrepresentation   
we then plotted sig versus accuracy for each objective function  to determine which objective functions correlated most strongly with biological relevance  figure 2   
correlation between accuracy and sig scores 
correlation between accuracy and sig scores  
non degenerate 6 mers from s  cerevisiae were scored according to sig scores based on  a  overrepresentation   b  overrepresentation ks   c  coverage and  d  ks metrics of statistical significance  
the 6 mers were randomly sampled from both the upstream regions and the known binding sites to ensure coverage or a wide range of accuracy  
the x axis plots the bonferroni corrected and log2 transformed sig score for each metric  
the red lines indicate the 95th sig percentile  
these plots demonstrate that overrepresentation is a closer approximation to biological relevance than coverage or ks alone  
adding ks to overrepresentation modestly improved the correlation by 13   as compared to overrepresentation alone  to r2   0 28  
to assess the degree of class separation achieved by the two objective functions  we ranked the sampled six mers by sig score  and calculated the percentage of motifs with high sig scores  in the 95th percentile and above  that possessed a reasonable degree of overlap with the known binding sites  accuracy     0 10   
by the overrepresentation measure  74 4  of high scoring motifs had accuracy   0 10  while 79 1  of high scoring motifs by ks overrepresentation had accuracy     0 10  
this analysis suggests that more complex objective functions may provide a better estimate of biological significance than the overrepresentation objective functions commonly used  
we thus chose to run scope using the overrepresentation ks combined objective function on the s  cerevisiae dataset  in which the upstream regions are of fixed length  
we used the overrepresentation objective function for the other species  as our upstream definitions for those species were of variable length due to the available annotations  
because identifying the genomic positions of highly degenerate bipartite motifs is prohibitively slow  initial rankings of motifs for spacer were computed using the overrepresentation objective function  and the overrepresentation ks objective function was used only to produce the final ordering and scores  
although the ks objective function is computationally expensive  linear in the frequency of the motif in the genome   the scope algorithms all aggressively limit the search space  thereby making the use of this objective function     and exploration of other complex objective functions     possible  
the surprisingly low correlations between sig and accuracy may indicate that the objective functions employed by motif finding programs are only a first approximation to biological significance  
further research into more biologically accurate objective functions may yield better performance for motif discovery algorithms  
evaluation of scope performance and ensemble learning scheme 
we first assessed the performance of the optimized scope framework on synthetic datasets  for details  see additional file 1  section s2   
scope performed well on the synthetic datasets  correctly identifying 92  of planted motifs that are over represented relative to background  those motifs with a sig score of greater than 5  figure 3   
performance at different overrepresentation sig values on synthetic data 
performance at different overrepresentation sig values on synthetic data  
a motif was  found  if the top scoring motif returned by scope overlapped the planted motif by at least 50   
a sig value of 0 implies that one motif of that significance is expected by chance  
while synthetic test sets are useful in algorithmic development and initial testing  the results of such tests must be taken with a grain of salt  as they are highly dependent on the model used to generate the test sets 6  
we therefore tested scope on an extensive array of regulons with known binding sites  for details of datasets  see additional file 1  section s3   
we ran scope on each regulon and  following the scoring methodology used by sinha and tompa 6  we computed the accuracy for each of the top three motifs reported by scope against the known binding sites  
the motifs reported by scope overlap to a large extent with the published cis regulatory elements  as discussed in additional file 1  section s3  a difference of one base pair length between the reported motif and the published cis regulatory element results in an expected accuracy of about 0 25   
scope was run on 78 regulons from s  cerevisiae  b  subtilis  e  coli and d  melanogaster  
on these datasets  scope s average accuracy was 0 28  0 29  0 16  and 0 08 respectively  
scope s reported accuracy was significantly higher than any of its component algorithms  table 1   
indeed  we found that scope increased accuracy by 31   44  over beam  prism or spacer alone  
this improvement was achieved by combining beam s high positive predictive value  ppv  with prism s high sensitivity  figure 4   
sensitivity is defined here as the fraction of the known binding sites  at the nucleotide level  predicted by the motif finder  and ppv is defined as the fraction of nucleotides predicted by the motif finder that correspond to the known binding sites  see methods for details   
summary results for performance comparisons between scope and its component algorithms  on all regulons  
a  win  is a regulon for which a program had the highest accuracy and that accuracy was at least 0 10  
programs in a two way tie are credited with 0 5 wins each  so by construction  scope can at best share a win with one of the other programs  
a perfect winner take all ensemble method would have the same number of wins as all the component algorithms combined  
a  clear win  loss   is a regulon for which scope s accuracy was at least 0 10 higher  lower  than the other program  
the p value reported for the paired t test was bonferroni corrected to account for multiple  three  comparisons  
average and standard error of sensitivity and ppv for the component algorithms of scope on all 78 regulons 
average and standard error of sensitivity and ppv for the component algorithms of scope on all 78 regulons  
bars represent standard error  
to provide a basis for evaluating the performance of scope s learning rule  we constructed an ensemble learning method  referred to here as baseline  from the results of beam  prism and spacer  by randomly selecting one of the accuracies from these three programs for each regulon  
over 120 000 trials  baseline s average performance on this dataset was 0 176 with a standard deviation of 0 013  
baseline s average score never exceeded that of scope  p   8 25    10 6   
when compared to its component algorithms  scope picked the highest accuracy motif in 66  of the cases  as opposed to 33  for a random selection between three algorithms   
these results suggest that scope s learning rule is highly effective  though it may certainly be improved further  
of course  scope s learning rule is extremely simple  and more complex learning rules may allow scope to approach its theoretical upper bound  
one rule that may prove effective is to weight the output of each algorithm according to  for example  the frequency of occurrence of each class of motif  non degenerate  short degenerate or long degenerate  in the species or by learning the appropriate weights on a representative training set  creating  in effect  a na  ve bayesian network  
the training of a more complex learning rule must  however  be performed in a cross validation framework  and the size of the available dataset of regulons will place a practical limit on the complexity of the learning rule that can be devised  
comparison with other motif finding programs 
to provide a frame of reference for scope s performance  we ran ten other popular motif finders on these datasets  for details and references see table 2   
we ran all programs directly from their websites  leaving all parameters at their defaults  
the only parameter that we specified  where available  was the species from which the background sequences were derived  
thus  the results of this performance comparison may be interpreted as a comparison against other motif finders when those motif finders are run using their default values  
motif discovery algorithms used in the performance comparison  
for motifsampler and wconsensus  the lower part of the range indicates required parameters  while the upper part indicates the total number of parameters  including  power user  parameters that the program authors stress should typically be left as default  
motif model abbreviations  cons   consensus  pwm   position weight matrix  mis   consensus with predefined number of allowed non position specific mismatches  
on synthetic datasets  we found scope s component algorithms to be quite robust to the settings of these hyperparameters  
this construction means that scope can only run in a default configuration  
we compared the motif finding programs using the criteria set forth in sinha and tompa  including average accuracy and the number of total wins  highest accuracy on a regulon  where that accuracy is at least 0 1  6  
on this dataset  scope had the highest score by both criteria  figure 5a   
the cumulative distribution of accuracy shows that scope had the most high scoring motifs at every level  figure 5b   
when we looked at the number of clear head to head wins  such a win is taken to occur when the difference in accuracy between scope and another motif finder is greater than 0 1 6   we found that scope scored a clear majority  82   of clear head to head wins  figure 5c   
the average accuracies of beam  prism and spacer on this dataset were similar to those of the ten other programs

performance in the presence of extraneous upstream sequences 
in practice  microarray co expression data are often used to identify genes in a particular regulon  
this approach identifies genes that are either directly or indirectly regulated by the transcription factor of interest  
therefore  sets of genes identified from co expression data may often contain multiple extraneous upstream sequences  
we thus tested scope s performance on regulons containing additional extraneous upstream sequences  
for all 33 regulons in the scpd dataset  we added randomly selected upstream s  cerevisiae sequences such that the total number of extraneous sequences was between 0 5 and 4 times the number of true upstream sequences in the regulon  
scope s accuracy on this dataset was remarkably stable in the presence of extraneous sequences  
figure 7 shows the aggregate results of this test  with the scpd regulons divided into three groups based on scope s accuracy on the true regulon  
for each set of regulons  scope s performance decayed gradually as increasing numbers of extraneous genes were added to the regulon  
these results were consistent with the relationship between the sig score and performance on synthetic datasets  figure 2

discussion 
the field of motif finding is saturated with a large number of algorithms representing myriad search strategies  objective functions and motif models  
a brief survey of the per regulon results of these performance comparisons yields two key observations   1  there are many regulons for which a large number of programs find a small portion of the binding sites  though not necessarily the same portion   and  2  every program has a respectable number of  wins   i e  every program is the best existing program on some handful of regulons 145678  
such observations are common in many machine learning applications  and are the direct result of complex search spaces that force restrictions on either the search strategy or the representation of the solution space  in this case  the motif model used to represent the motifs   
for example  ymf and rsat are guaranteed to find the optimal solutions in their motif space  fixed length motifs with limited degeneracies   but that space is limited to the point that optimality provides no clear advantage over the other methods  
the hlk ensemble method 4 successfully exploits the first key observation above  
by running the same  stochastic  algorithm multiple times and using a voting method  those subsequences of the binding sites that are repeatedly reported become clear while the spurious bases are eliminated  
hu and colleagues report that this method increased accuracy and proposed that their approach may prove effective when running different algorithms as well 4  
in such cases  it is likely that a voting based ensemble will follow the crowd and fail to find the true binding site  
the second observation  that all motif finders win some number of regulons and often perform roughly the same on average  is broadly consistent with a theorem in the machine learning field referred to as the no free lunch theorem 1819  
briefly  this theorem states that  averaged over all datasets  the performance of all search algorithms are exactly the same  with the corollary that two algorithms will have the exact same number of wins in relation to each other  
in practice  this theorem argues for the use of specialized domain knowledge 20  where available  and may suggest that similar average performance across a diversity of approaches is an indication of the diversity of the datasets themselves  
thus  motif finders designed for one class of motifs will win on regulons containing those motifs  but will perform poorly on other regulons  while more general motif finders will tend to have more consistently mediocre performance  
the working hypothesis is  in effect  that the local maxima are predictable  corresponding to one of three motif classes  and exploitable  we can find the local maxima in each class and choose whichever is higher   
consistent with this hypothesis  there was very little overlap among the component algorithms of scope  each wins about 20 of the 78 regulons  with very few ties  and  by taking the maximum score from those three local maxima  scope tended to choose the motif with the highest accuracy in a clear majority of the cases  66   compared to 33  for a random learning rule   
furthermore  scope not only significantly outperformed its components on this dataset  it also outperformed a number of general purpose algorithms that seek to find the global maximum in a single pass  
of course  based on the no free lunch theorem  scope s performance averaged over all theoretically possible datasets will still converge to that of the other motif finding approaches  including random guessing   
as the physical properties of transcription factors will inevitably constrain the structure of their binding sites  biologically relevant datasets comprise a subset of the space of all theoretically possible sequences  
our test set of 78 regulons was selected in a blinded manner  for details  see additional file 1  section s3   thus these results suggest the generalizability of scope s use of domain knowledge on biologically relevant datasets from these species  
it is possible that more power could be gained by identifying other distinct motif classes and adding algorithms that explicitly search for those classes  
for example  zinc finger transcription factors have been demonstrated to bind three triplets of nucleotides which overlap at their third base positions 21  
this observation could be leveraged by a search algorithm that explicitly searches for motifs matching this unique structure  
thus  all nondegenerate triplets in a set of upstream regions could be scored and the highest scoring triplets combined into a single five mer with a two base degeneracy  corresponding to the iupac characters r y  w  s  k or m  at the middle position  
the highest scoring five mers could then be combined with the highest scoring triplets to generate a seven mer with two base degeneracies at positions three and five  
provided the appropriate bonferroni correction is applied for this new class of motifs  these motifs may be easily compared with the results from beam  prism and spacer  thereby extending the scope ensemble to include a fourth class of motifs  
we note  however  that as more methods are added to scope  it will be increasingly difficult to devise a scoring metric that can accurately choose the best result from among the components  
scope may also serve as a complementary approach to the hlk method  
for example  the parameters of many methods can be set to search for specific classes of motifs  such as bipartite versus non bipartite motifs   
thus  analogous to the ensemble method described in this paper  one may build a hierarchical ensemble that first searches each motif class by the hlk method using a number of algorithms or random restarts  and then uses the scope method to choose the best result from among the motif classes  
one constraint associated with such an approach is the run time  
a second constraint associated with a hierarchical ensemble learning method is the multiplicative increase in the number of parameters associated with it  though this problem may be ameliorated by the use of parameter free algorithms that employ restricted search spaces  
an important factor to consider when taking the best of multiple runs is the relative size of the search space  
certainly to maintain statistical validity  some correction must be made for multiple hypothesis testing  
furthermore  the effects of multiple testing may bias the results in favor of one of the component algorithms  
to ensure statistical validity and avoid such a bias  we developed a simple bonferroni like correction  which penalized every proposed motif proportional to its length and degree of degeneracy  resulting in a modest improvement of 8  in scope s accuracy  
nevertheless  as larger datasets become available  scope s efficient search strategy makes it an ideal platform for exploring the effect of focused improvements to the motif finding approach described  such as the use of complex objective functions that may better approximate biological significance  
the comparisons to other motif finding programs in this study are provided to place scope s performance in the broader context of the motif finding field  particularly when viewed from the standpoint of the practicing  bench  biologist  
any performance comparison must be interpreted with caution  since the results are highly dependent on the dataset used  the conditions of the testing and the metrics used for evaluation  
with this in mind  we sought to evaluate a wide representation of motif finders on a large number of regulons using performance metrics consistent with previous studies 67  
to the best of our knowledge  this dataset represents the largest set of biologically relevant regulons used for performance comparisons to date  
our comparison thus complements the recent large scale study of tompa et al   who gauge performance under optimal conditions on semi synthetic data sets 5  as well as the study of hu et al   who explore the effect of parameter optimization on a handful of popular motif finders 4  
although previous studies have shown the potential importance of choosing parameters carefully 46  we note that the results we obtained under default settings were quite similar to those reported in previous studies  for details  see additional file 1  section s3   
arguably  systematic parameter optimization for each of these programs may well yield higher accuracy scores than those reported here  
however  in order to avoid the pitfall of overfitting to the dataset  such parameter optimization must be performed using cross validation or some other resampling technique 92223  
we note that all the motif finders tested  including scope  performed poorly on the drosophila dataset  
although scope had the highest accuracy on this dataset  that accuracy was significantly less than on the bacterial and yeast data  
one possible cause of poor performance in this study is that the   regulons   are derived from enhancer regions defined in an earlier computational paper 24  
whereas a background set of promoter regions is easy to identify  it is not clear how to define a reasonable genomic sample of enhancers  
the persistently poor performance of motif finders on drosophila regulons thus highlights the importance of using well defined background sequences to calibrate the statistics of the objective functions being optimized  
recently  algorithms have been reported that predict enhancer regions on a genome wide scale  2425262728   
it is possible that using such algorithms to define a collection of background enhancer sequences may improve the performance of scope  as well as that of the other motif finders  on drosophila  
conclusion 
typically  ensemble learning methods are plagued with certain liabilities  such as increased runtimes  logistical complexity and a multiplicity of nuisance parameters  all of which grow with the number of programs run  
in the machine learning field  ensemble methods have coexisted for many years with non ensemble methods  with no clear superiority having been established between the two  
scope serves as a proof of concept  demonstrating an efficient and effective approach to ensemble based motif finding  
by dividing the search space into tractable domains  scope mitigates the potential liabilities associated with ensemble methods  resulting in a program that is capable of finding cis regulatory elements of arbitrary length  degree of degeneracy  motif orientation and frequency of occurrence  
its strong performance  rapid runtime and freedom from nuisance parameters make it a simple and effective tool for the biologist  
methods 
accuracy  sensitivity and positive predictive value 
each algorithm s accuracy for each regulon was measured via the phi score  also referred to as nucleotide level performance coefficient  or npc  in previous performance comparisons 45611  
this metric  first proposed by pevzner and sze 29  measures the degree of overlap between the actual instances of two motifs  or sets of motifs  m1 and m2 in the set of co regulated upstream sequences  
the phi score can be defined as follows  let u be a unique numbering of all the bases in the upstream sequences of a given gene set  and iu m      u be the set of bases that are covered by actual instances of m in u  
phi is then defined as the ratio of the number of bases occupied by the actual instances of both the motifs  to the total number of bases occupied by the actual instances of either of the two motifs  
  u m1  m2     iu m1      iu m2    iu m1      iu m2    
this metric therefore takes both false positives and false negatives into account at the level of the individual bases that are actually covered by the motif  
as in hu et al  4  we define accuracy to be the phi score between the known and predicted binding sites  
changing the denominator of the phi equation to be iu mi  yields the sensitivity  if mi represents the true binding sites  or the positive predictive value  ppv  if mi represents the reported binding sites   
see additional file 1  section s3  for a discussion on the use of phi score for measuring accuracy  
objective functions for statistical significance 
in line with other motif finders  we have used statistical significance as a surrogate for biological significance  
in this section  we detail the objective functions we used and their effect on scope s performance  
for any motif m  each objective function provides a definition for p m   the probability of observing a motif with the same sufficient statistics as m assuming a particular null model  
this p value is used in the computation of the sig score  see results   
overrepresentation 
the most common statistical test in motif finding is based on overrepresentation  which can be roughly defined as the probability that a motif m that is observed c m  times in the regulon would occur at least c m  times in a random collection of the same number of genes  
in the context of consensus motifs  overrepresentation is expressed in terms of a multinomial model  in which each position i in each gene j is a random variable xij that can take on any motif allowed by the particular motif model  
the probability of seeing m at least c m  times in the regulon can be approximated by the poisson distribution  p m       k   c m      ke     k    where    is the expectation of c m  with respect to the null motif distribution and the number of positions in the regulon  
a detailed justification of this approach was given by carlson et al  11  
the expectation    is most accurately modeled using maximum likelihood estimators  mles  computed as the actual proportion of any given motif in the complete set of all upstream sequences in the genome 10  
these mles are implemented as lookups of exact substrings  which can be performed efficiently using a suffix array data structure 101112  
coverage 
a simple modification to the overrepresentation objective function is coverage  which is identical to overrepresentation with the modification that c m  is the number of upstream regions in the regulon that have one or more instances of m and     the expectation of c m   is determined from the proportion of upstream regions in the genome that contain the motif  
positional bias 
transcription factors often require their binding sites to be located in a restricted range relative to the start of transcription  
one well known example is tbp  tata binding protein   which localizes the rna polymerase complex by binding the tata box motif roughly 25 bases upstream of the transcription start site 30  
while other examples of binding sites with positional restrictions are well known  few motif finders incorporate position in their scoring function  
in the case where all upstream regions are the same length  the kolmogorov smirnov  ks  statistic provides a natural test for positional bias  
the kolmogorov smirnov  ks  statistic is a non parametric statistic that measures the probability that two samples are drawn from the same distribution  
let x be the sample that we wish to compare to some reference sample y  
the ks statistic is defined to be the maximum absolute difference between the unbiased cumulative distribution functions of x and y  
the ks statistic has a well defined distribution from which a p value can be easily computed  
kuiper s variation was used to increase sensitivity in the tails of the distribution 31  
in the context of motifs  we defined the test sample x for a motif m to be the set of starting positions  with respect to transcription start sites  of m in the regulon  
the reference sample y is defined as the set of starting positions of m in all upstream regions in the genome  
thus  pks m  is a measure of how m is localized differently in the regulon than in the genome as a whole  
it is also possible to define y as the uniform distribution  however  we found that many motifs had non uniform distributions throughout all upstream regions of the genome  possibly as an artifact of the non uniform at cg distributions in upstream regions 32  
combining overrepresentation and positional bias 
since overrepresentation and ks are independent  the probabilities can simply be multiplied together to yield the probability of randomly sampling a motif with a given degree of overrepresentation and positional bias  
motif orientation 
many transcription factors will bind motifs on either dna strand  
others  such as the general transcription factor tbp  tata binding protein   require a specific orientation and will only function if bound to motifs on a specific dna strand 30  
in scoring a motif m  a choice must therefore be made as to whether or not the reverse complement mr of m will be considered to be the same motif as m  
such an assumption may be overly generous     as the tbp example above makes clear  the transcriptional machinery of a cell is clearly able to differentiate between the two strands  
we thus chose to attach a flag to each motif  indicating whether or not the motif should be orientation neutral  
beam and spacer thus enumerate and evaluate all motifs with both values of this flag  
scope reports that orientation does matter  i e  m     mr  for 17  of the regulons in our biological test set  
reuse of structural domain   domain interactions in protein networks 
abstract 
background 
protein interactions are thought to be largely mediated by interactions between structural domains  
databases such as ipfam relate interactions in protein structures to known domain families  
here  we investigate how the domain interactions from the ipfam database are distributed in protein interactions taken from the hprd  mpact  biogrid  dip and intact databases  
results 
we find that known structural domain interactions can only explain a subset of 4   19  of the available protein interactions  nevertheless this fraction is still significantly bigger than expected by chance  
there is a correlation between the frequency of a domain interaction and the connectivity of the proteins it occurs in  
furthermore  a large proportion of protein interactions can be attributed to a small number of domain interactions  
we conclude that many  but not all  domain interactions constitute reusable modules of molecular recognition  
a substantial proportion of domain interactions are conserved between e  coli  s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens  
these domains are related to essential cellular functions  suggesting that many domain interactions were already present in the last universal common ancestor  
conclusion 
our results support the concept of domain interactions as reusable  conserved building blocks of protein interactions  but also highlight the limitations currently imposed by the small number of available protein structures  
background 
one way to understand a protein s function is to look at its composition of conserved domains  
such families of related sequence regions  collected in the pfam database 1  usually constitute structurally and functionally conserved modules  
it is assumed that binding interfaces  too  are conserved evolutionary modules that are reused between proteins of different functions and retained during evolution 23  
therefore  domain   domain interactions are often regarded as the currency of protein   protein interactions  
based on this assumption  ng et al  described an approach to predict domain   domain interactions using literature curation  evolutionary history and the distribution of domains in protein interactions 4  
wuchty et al  compared the relationship between this set of predicted interacting domain pairs to the domain coocurrence network 5  
more recently  other groups have come up with sophisticated statistical methods to estimate putatively interacting domain pairs  based on the assumption of domain reusability 678910  
for complexes with known structure  it has been shown that domains can mediate interactions 1112  
such interactions between pairs of domains are stored in the ipfam database 13  
the structural evidence lends strong support to the inferred domain pair  resulting in a high confidence set of domain pairs  
unfortunately  the selection of complexes in the pdb database of protein structures 14 is rather small and biased 15  
there is often only a single structure that shows a certain protein pair to interact  while other complexes like haemoglobin have been crystalized dozens of times  
this makes it difficult to assess whether some domain pairs act as reusable modules in protein interactions from pdb data alone  
high throughput experiments 161718 and extensive literature curation efforts 19 have yielded large databases of protein interactions 2021222324  
despite the continuing growth of protein interaction databases  even the best studied protein interaction network of s  cerevisiae is thought to be incomplete and inaccurate 252627  
given that this network already comprises around 60000 interactions  questions arise as to how such networks have evolved and how they are organised  
furthermore  methods for assessing the quality of high throughput experimental results are in high demand due to the error prone nature of the methods used  
in this study  we investigate how pairs of protein families taken from ipfam are distributed in experimental protein interactions from five major model species  
this allows us to address a number of questions   what proportion of each organism s protein interaction network  its interactome  can be attributed to a known domain   domain interaction  
how conserved are domain   domain pairs between species  and how many interacting domain pairs are still unknown  
results 
ipfam domain pairs are overrepresented in experimental protein interactions 
we analysed the distribution of pfam families known to interact from a pdb structure  ipfam domain pairs  in experimentally derived protein interactions  experimental interactions   
the experimental interactions were filtered to only include interactions with exactly two partners  see methods   
the fraction of experimental interactions that contain at least one ipfam domain pair is referred to as the ipfam coverage  
accordingly  the fraction of experimental interactions that contains any pair of pfam domains  excluding the ipfam domain pairs  is called the pfam coverage  
figure 1 shows the pfam and ipfam coverage for the analysed species as a column chart  
the number of resolved protein interactions varies greatly between species  as does the size of the underlying proteome  see table 1   
the pfam coverage  coloured red in figure 1  lies between 49 46  and 66 73   
the ipfam coverage  shown in blue  is much smaller  ranging from 2 92  in d  melanogaster to 19 02  in h  sapiens  
in s  cerevisiae the species with the most comprehensively studied interactome  the ipfam coverage is 4 47   
comparison of coverage of ipfam domain pairs on protein interactions 
comparison of coverage of ipfam domain pairs on protein interactions  
for each species  the height of the column reflects the number of known protein   protein interactions in the data set  
ipfam domain pair coverage on protein interactions 
for each species  we list the size of the proteome as defined in integr8 and the fraction of this proteome that is represented in the protein interaction sets  followed by the total number of binary protein interactions and the fraction of those that contain an ipfam domain pair  
the last two columns show the results of the network shuffling experiments  
the relatively low ipfam coverage is by itself a disappointing finding  
however  the fact that only a small fraction of protein interactions contain known domain pairs could be a result of the scarcity of available structures of protein complexes  
therefore  we asked whether the observed ipfam coverage is larger than would be expected by chance  
to test this  we created 1000 random networks per species using the algorithm described in methods  
we then calculated the ipfam coverage on the protein interactions in each randomised network  
mean and standard deviations of the randomisation experiments are shown in table 1  
this proves that the observed ipfam coverage is significantly higher than expected and ipfam domain pairs are enriched in real experimental protein interactions  
few ipfam domain pairs are responsible for a majority of the coverage 
to understand why ipfam domain pairs occur more often in experimental interactions than expected by chance  we analysed the two largest data sets  s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens in more detail  
in the following paragraph  we will call the experimental interactions that contain an ipfam domain pair the covered experimental interactions  
in figure 2  we compare the distribution of ipfam domain pairs on the number of experimental interactions for e  coli  s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens  
this plot reflects how many ipfam domain pairs cover how many experimental interactions  
domain pairs that cluster to the left of the plot can be called specific domain pairs  as they only occur in very few covered experimental interactions  
conversely  domain pairs that cluster to the right of the plot occur in a large number of different covered experimental interactions and can be called promiscuous domain pairs  
frequencies of ipfam domain pairs in e  coli  s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens protein interactions 
frequencies of ipfam domain pairs in e  coli  s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens protein interactions  
each point in this graph represents a set of protein interactions  
the abscissa reflects the number of interactions in each set that contain the same ipfam domain pair  
the ordinate shows the number of distinct such sets  each defined by a different ipfam domain pair  
dotted lines denote fitted monomial functions  showing that the distributions follow a power law  
all three distributions in figure 2 resemble a power law distribution  according to the good fit of log linear functions  log f x     k log x   log a  shown as dotted lines  
the slopes k of the h  sapiens and s  cerevisiae distributions are very similar   1 53 and  1 60  respectively   while e  coli has a markedly smaller slope   2 78   
this suggests that the ratio of specific to promiscuous ipfam domain pairs is very similar in s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens  whereas e  coli features fewer multiply reoccurring ipfam domain pairs  
the power law distribution of ipfam frequencies implies that the majority of covered protein interactions can be attributed to a minority of ipfam domain pairs  
51 7  of the ipfam domain pairs in s  cerevisiae and 45 3  in h  sapiens are seen in just one experimental interaction  
conversely  92 4  of h  sapiens and 85 4  of s  cerevisiae covered experimental interactions contain an ipfam domain pair that occurs more than once  
even more  half of the covered experimental interactions in h  sapiens contain an ipfam domain pair that occurs in more than 16 different experimental interactions  5 for s  cerevisiae   
degree distribution and ipfam domain pair frequency are correlated 
we reasoned that if there are ipfam domain pairs that act as reusable modules in protein interactions  then highly connected proteins should also be more likely to contain promiscuous ipfam domain pairs and vice versa  
for each node  i e  protein  in the filtered h  sapiens and s  cerevisiae protein interaction network  we calculated its degree  defined as the number of adjacent edges  i e  interactions   
at the same time  we counted the number of ipfam domain pairs on the adjacent edges  
in figure 3  we plot the mean number of ipfam domain pairs relative to the degree of the node  
average frequency of ipfam domain pairs relative to degree of node 
average frequency of ipfam domain pairs relative to degree of node  
each point represents a protein in the interaction networks of h  sapiens  blue  and s  cerevisiae  green   
for each protein  we calculate the degree  defined as the number of interactions the protein is involved in  
on the y axis  we show the average number of ipfam domain pairs in edges adjacent to proteins of degree x  
we calculated a spearman correlation of 0 68 and 0 71  for h  sapiens and s  cerevisiae  
the correlation is outlined by dotted lines  
we find that for proteins from a degree of 1 to 50  there is strong correlation in both h  sapiens and s  cerevisiae  spearman correlation coefficients of 0 68 and 0 71  respectively  between degree and number of ipfam domain pairs on adjacent edges  
for the 1 2  of proteins in h  sapiens and 6 4  in s  cerevisiae which have a degree higher than 50  the correlation gradually diminishes  
promiscuous domain pairs 
additional file 1 contains a list of all ipfam domain pairs and their frequencies in the experimental protein interactions  while additional file 4 lists the frequencies of the single domains  
interactions between protein kinase domains  pkinase  pfam acc  pf00069 and pkinase_tyr  pfam acc  pf07714  are the most frequent ipfam domain pairs  as well as interactions involving recognition domains such as sh2 or sh3  
in s  cerevisiae  the proteasome family  pfam acc  pf00227  a family of peptidases  and wd40  pfam acc  pf00400  a repeat involved in multimer assembly  are also amongst the five most frequent ipfam domain pairs  
as expected  more frequent domains are also more likely to be found as pairs in interacting proteins  
it should be noted however that in the pdb structures  some of the observed domain pairs  pkinase_tyr     sh3_1  pkinase_c     pkinase and others  are only seen to interact within one protein  intrachain interactions  as opposed to interactions between two distinct proteins  interchain interaction   
the table in additional file 5 lists the number of pdb structures for each ipfam domain pair  distinguishing between intrachain and interchain interactions  
looking for example at the covered experimental interactions in h  sapiens additional file 1   only 8 out of the 100 most frequent ipfam domain pairs are seen in intrachain interactions exclusively  while 61 are exclusive to interchain interactions and 31 are seen in both  
a possible explanation for the occurrence of purely intrachain ipfam domain pairs in the covered experimental interactions is that they frequently cooccur together on the same protein with other ipfam domain pairs  
a list of all combinations of ipfam domains  the domain architecture  on interacting proteins is given in additional file 2  
it reveals that certain ipfam domains such as sh2  sh3_1 or pkinase_tyr frequently occur in the same architecture  
this highlights a basic assumption of this study that could be a source of error  
we assume that interacting proteins that contain an ipfam domain pair interact through these domains  
this  of course  is not necessarily the case  
although it has been shown that sequence similarity is linked to the mode of interaction 28  not every protein interaction that contains an ipfam domain pair is necessarily mediated by exactly this domain pair  
this means that for more than 32  of the protein interactions in the pdb  the ipfam domain pair assignment is correct  
for the remaining 68   the ipfam domain pair assignments are wrong in one case but correct in another  
the real false positive rate is likely to be smaller  because some ipfam domain pairs might still independently mediate an interaction with a different  possibly unknown  partner protein  
ipfam domain pairs are enriched in s  cerevisiae complexes 
we tested whether ipfam domain pairs are enriched in known protein complexes from s  cerevisiae  
this is interesting firstly because domain   domain interactions are thought to be more common in obligate interactions  
secondly  the described modularity of known s  cerevisiae complexes lends support to the assumption that the underlying ipfam domain pairs are modular  
in fact  we find a two fold enrichment for ipfam domain pairs in the complexes described by gavin et al  29  
from the 294 binary protein interactions in this data set  24 contained an ipfam domain pair  which corresponds to a coverage of 8 16   p value 2 7    10 47   
we also analysed the full dataset of protein complexes  
from 491 complexes described by gavin et al   157 contained at least one pair of proteins with an ipfam domain pair  31 9    
in total we found 617 pairs of proteins that contained an ipfam domain pair  
interestingly  we find that the distribution of ipfam domain pairs on complexes is uneven  
when we drew 617 protein pairs randomly from all possible protein pairs in the complexes  we covered 192 complexes on average  with a standard deviation of 7 22  
the probability of covering only 157 complexes is just 6 24    10 07  
this suggests that some sets of domain pairs are specific to certain complexes or pathways  
typical examples are the rna polymerase ii complex  intact id  ebi 815049  or the u1 snrnp complex which contain numerous ipfam domain pairs that are specific to these complexes  
ipfam domain pairs are conserved between species 
within the 3 to 19  of experimental interactions covered by ipfam  we analysed the conservation of ipfam domain pairs between species  
we call an ipfam domain pair conserved when the same pair is observed in experimental interactions of two different species  
the matrix in table 2 shows the pair wise conservation of ipfam domain pairs  
for each species  a maximum of 40  to 90  of ipfam domain pairs can also be found in another species  although not all overlaps are as large  
matrix of mutual shared ipfam domain pairs 
the table shows the number of co occurences of ipfam domain pairs between two species  
the right most column lists the total number of unique ipfam pairs found in each species  experimental interactions  
figure 4 shows a venn diagram of the mutual overlaps between the two eukaryotes s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens and the prokaryote e  coli  
while the eukaryotes share 524 domain pairs  only 158 ipfam domain pairs are shared between s  cerevisiae and e  coli  and only 135 between e  coli and h  sapiens  
remarkably  53  of the observed ipfam domain pairs in e  coli are also observed in one of the two eukaryotes  and 107 ipfam domain pairs are even conserved amongst all three species  
the ipfam domains in these pairs are related to housekeeping activities such as translation  replication or atp synthesis  
additional file 3 contains a list of the conserved ipfam domain pairs

venn diagramm showing the fractions of ipfam domain pairs found in the e  coli  s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens binary protein interaction sets  
the three circles represent the ipfam domain pairs observed in the respective species  
the overlaps denote co observed ipfam domain pairs  
we also compared the ipfam domain pair frequencies between h  sapiens and s  cerevisiae directly  
we derive a spearman correlation coefficient of 0 50 for the frequencies of all 524 ipfam domain pairs that are conserved between s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens  
to test whether the correlation is an artefact of the distribution of the values  we recalculated the correlation 1000 times  each time shuffling one distribution randomly  
from these random results  we derive a p value of 3 6    10 30 that the observed correlation is random  
this suggests that ipfam domain pairs with a large number of occurrences in one species tend also to be more frequent in the other  
predicting the total number of ipfam domain pairs in nature 
our analysis allow us to estimate how many ipfam domain pairs would eventually cover all protein interactions  
this corresponds to the predictions made by aloy and russel 2  
similar to their approach  we make a linear estimation with the following factors  
  s the number of ipfam domain pairs observed in species s 
  s the number of observed interactions in species s that contain an ipfam domain pair 
  s the total number of observed interactions in species s 
  s the number of proteins from species s that are seen in an interaction screen 
  s the proteome size for species s 
  s the number of pfam domains observed in all protein of species s 
   the total number of known pfam domains 
we denote the estimated number of ipfam domain pairs in species s with x s  
the formula we apply is x s   s     s  s     s  s 
this means we scale the observed number of ipfam domain pairs to cover all observed interactions  
we then use the relative proteome coverage to estimate the total number of ipfam domain pairs in all proteins  
finally  we follow the argument of aloy and russel that the number of pfam families seen in species s indicates the fraction of the protein universe represented in the species  
we therefore predict the total number of ipfam domain pairs x  as x  x s       s  
both parameters and results of the calculation are shown in table 3  
the estimates for the total number of ipfam domain pairs ranges from 33813 to 120511  with an average of 76918

discussion 
ipfam coverage is low 
the coverage of ipfam on experimentally derived protein interactions is low  
for s  cerevisiae  the species with the best mapped interactome  only 4 47  of the protein interactions contain an ipfam domain pair  
this reveals the limits of our understanding of the molecular structure of protein interactions  
figure 1 also shows that a majority of protein interactions contains at least one pair of pfam domains  
this in turn creates new targets for future structural genomics projects 30  
prioritising these targets according to the number of covered experimental interactions could increase the coverage of databases like ipfam quickly  
we find  however  that ipfam domain pairs occur significantly more often in experimental interactions than would be expected by chance  
this requires that at least a subset of the ipfam domain pairs are reused in several experimental interactions  
ipfam domain pairs can act as modules 
despite the low overall coverage  ipfam domain pairs are found in more protein interactions than would be expected by chance  see table 1   
this statistical overrepresentation suggests that certain ipfam domain pairs constitute modules of molecular recognition which are reused in different protein interactions 2  
in fact  we find a characteristic power law distribution when we plot the histogram of experimental interactions per ipfam domain pair  see figure 2  
this underlines that a few promiscuous ipfam domain pairs are responsible for the majority of the ipfam coverage  
these ipfam domain pairs are most likely to be reusable modules  
in fact  we find the most frequent ipfam domain pairs to be recognition domains in signal transduction  
conversely  a large number of ipfam domain pairs are specific to a small number of protein interactions  
this implies that recognition specificity amongst proteins is often achieved by maintaining an exclusive interacting domain pair  
this could pose a problem for purely statistical approaches to infer domain interactions   if for many interfaces the real interacting domain pair will only occur once in an interactome  it will be hard to elucidate this on a statistical basis  
the concept of modularity of interacting domain pairs is furthermore supported by the positive correlation between the number of protein interactions an ipfam domain pair is seen in and the connectivity of the interacting proteins  
we hypothesise that if during the course of evolution a protein is duplicated  it is likely to retain connections with other proteins which contain the same domain interaction modules  
it is clear  however  that even though recognition domains are reused in various proteins  their specificity is bound to be controlled  
many domain   domain interfaces remain to be resolved 
we tried to estimate how many ipfam domain pairs exists in all interactomes  
our predictions lie almost an order of magnitude higher than the 10000 domain interaction types proposed by aloy and russel 2  
while all such estimates should be taken with caution  our results show that at best 10  of all structural domain pairs are represented in ipfam  
the statistical approaches described in the introduction can only cover a small fraction of this domaininteraction space  
riley et al  for example report only 3005 interacting domain pairs which could be inferred from protein interactions 7  
even under the assumption that many interactions involve short linear motifs  it seems likely that a large number of domain interactions remain to be resolved  
ipfam domain pairs are conserved during evolution 
ipfam domain pairs are not only recurrent within the protein interaction network of one species  
they also appear to be conserved between species  
in a small set of protein structures from s  cerevisiae  it has been shown that interacting domain pairs are more conserved than non interacting domain pairs 10  
here  we call an ipfam domain pair conserved if there are protein interactions in two species which contain the same ipfam domain pair  
in a recent study 31  gandhi et al  have assessed the conservation of protein interactions as the co occurrence of orthologous interacting proteins  
they found only 16 orthologous interacting protein pairs that were conserved in s  cerevisiae  c  elegans  d  melanogaster and h  sapiens  
conversely  we find that 71 ipfam domain pairs are conserved in the experimental interactions of these species  
even between a prokaryote like e  coli and the two eukaryotes s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens there is a considerable proportion of conserved ipfam domain pairs  to the extent that 53  of the ipfam domain pairs from e  coli are also observed in a eukaryote  table 2   
107 domain pairs are shared between e  coli  s  cerevisiae and h  sapiens  
these domains are predominantly related to transcription  translation and other basic essential cellular activities  which is in congruence with the findings of gandhi et al  
although the low overall ipfam coverage hampers the interpretation of our results  it looks as if there has been a diversification of domain interactions from e  coli to h  sapiens  
while more than half of the ipfam domain pairs in e  coli have been retained throughout evolution  numerous new ones seem to have emerged in eukaryotic development  
conversely  this also raises the question of whether one could establish a comprehensive set of domain interactions that were present in the last universal common ancestor  
conclusion 
in this study  we addressed the utility of current knowledge about structural domain interactions in order to interpret experimental protein interactions  
disappointingly  only a small fraction of all experimental interactions can be attributed to a known domain interaction  
within this subset of interactions  we nevertheless made several reassuring observations  structural domain pairs are enriched in experimental protein interactions  
some of the domain pairs seem to mediate a large number of protein interactions  thus acting as reusable connectors  
this property is also conserved between species  
taken as a whole  this further underlines that solving structures of protein complexes should be an important focus for future structural genomics projects  
targeting the most frequent domain pairs would increase the coverage of databases such as ipfam  shedding more light onto the molecular mechanisms underpinning cellular networks  
methods 
protein interaction data 
the complete interaction sets from biogrid 20  dip 21  hprd 22  intact 23 and mpact 24 were downloaded  
a wide range of databases were used to cover as many distinct experimental data sets as possible  
biogrid for example contains a large manually curated set of protein interactions for s  cerevisiae 19  
similarily  hprd hosts a set of manually curated protein interactions for h  sapiens  
intact on the other hand contains results from high throughput screens and integrates data from other protein interaction databases as part of the imex collaboration  
the mpact database combines the manually curated s  cerevisiae protein complexes data set formerly known as the mips complexes with other high throughput interaction experiments data  
taken together  these databases represent most of the protein interactions currently stored in machine accessible form  
despite great efforts to unify access to protein interaction data 32  acquiring large data sets from diverse sources is still far from trivial and error prone  
the psi mi xml data exchange format provided by the aforementioned databases was used to generate a local relational database of protein interactions  
all entries were mapped to uniprot 33 by either relying on existing annotations from the source databases or by pair wise sequence alignment to all uniprot proteins from the same species as the query protein  
the direct sequence comparison was performed using pmatch  a very fast pairwise alignment algorithm developed by richard durbin  unpublished  source code available 34   
species 
to allow cross species comparisons  the data were split into five distinct species sets  e  coli  s  cerevisiae  c  elegans  d  melanogaster and h  sapiens  
it should be noted that the proportion of proteins for which an interaction is known varies greatly between the species  see table 1  
this might affect the results if there is a systematic bias on the composition of a protein interaction set  
to prevent bias from multiple alternative versions of the same protein  all interacting proteins were mapped to reference proteomes as defined by integr8 35  again using pmatch  
the total number of missing proteins will be lower  as several entries from different databases refer to the same sequence  
ipfam 
the ipfam database is derived from protein structures deposited in the pdb  
regions in every protein structure that match a pfam domain are scanned for interactions with residues in another pfam domain  
all such interacting domain pairs are stored in a database together with detailed information on the residues involved 13  
every pair of pfam families that are found to interact in a pdb structure are called an ipfam domain pair throughout the text  
single pfam families that are part of an ipfam domain pair are then called ipfam domains  
for example  in pdb entry 1k9a the two ipfam domains sh2  pfam accession pf00017  and pkinase_tyr  pf07714  interact  therefore they form an ipfam domain pair  
in this study  ipfam version 21 was employed  containing 2837 ipfam domains  forming 4030 ipfam domain pairs  
figure 5 shows the species distribution of ipfam domain pairs  
h  sapiens  e  coli and s  cerevisiae are clearly over represented compared to the other 1113 species with less than 179 complex structures  
some ipfam domain pairs are seen to form interactions between distinct peptide chains in the structure  interchain   while others form an interaction between two distinct domains within the same chain  intrachain   
in ipfam version 21  there are 3407 interchain and 1171 intrachain domain pairs  which means that 548 domain pairs mediate both inter  and intrachain interactions  
in this analysis  both types of domain interactions were used equivalently  assuming that intrachain interactions can become interchain interactions and vice versa as a result of a gene fission fusion events  
species distribution of ipfam domain pairs 
species distribution of ipfam domain pairs  
this pie chart shows how many ipfam domain pairs were found in pdb structures from each species  
the total number is larger than the 4030 unique ipfam pairs in the database because an ipfam pair can be found in structures from several species  
filtering 
there are many types of experiments used to derive protein interactions  with different properties and error rates  
for this analysis  solely the properties of physically interacting proteins is of interest  
therefore  only interactions between exactly two proteins per experiment were considered  
that means all protein complex data that were derived by co purification methods were removed  unless a particular experiment had identified exactly two binding partners  
all genetic interactions were also removed  
random networks 
randomised protein interaction networks with identical degree distributions were generated from the original filtered experimental interaction data for each species  
in each randomisation step  a mapping is created that assigns every node a randomly chosen replacement node  
in this way the edges of the network remain in place  while the nodes are shuffled randomly  
instead  this behaviour simulates a network with a high false positive rate  
p values 
p values for observations x were calculated as p x     x    f x           where f x          is the probability density function of the normal distribution with mean    and standard deviation     
   and    are estimated through the randomisation experiments  
the density function thus provides the probability that a value less than or equal to x is observed by chance  given the distribution estimated by a random resampling method  
where appropriate  the inverse probability p x   x    1   f x          was applied  
two distinct e3 ubiquitin ligases have complementary functions in the regulation of delta and serrate signaling in drosophila 
abstract 
signaling by the notch ligands delta  dl  and serrate  ser  regulates a wide variety of essential cell fate decisions during animal development  
two distinct e3 ubiquitin ligases  neuralized  neur  and mind bomb  mib   have been shown to regulate dl signaling in drosophila melanogaster and danio rerio  respectively  
we show here that the drosophila mind bomb  d mib  gene regulates a subset of notch signaling events  including wing margin specification  leg segmentation  and vein determination  that are distinct from those events requiring neur activity  
d mib also modulates lateral inhibition  a neur  and dl dependent signaling event  suggesting that d mib regulates dl signaling  
during wing development  expression of d mib in dorsal cells appears to be necessary and sufficient for wing margin specification  indicating that d mib also regulates ser signaling  
moreover  the activity of the d mib gene is required for the endocytosis of ser in wing imaginal disc cells  
we conclude that d mib and neur are two structurally distinct proteins that have similar molecular activities but distinct developmental functions in drosophila  
introduction 
cell to cell signaling mediated by receptors of the notch  n  family has been implicated in various developmental decisions in organisms ranging from nematodes to mammals  1   
n is well known for its role in lateral inhibition  a key patterning process that organizes the regular spacing of distinct cell types within groups of equipotent cells  
additionally  n mediates inductive signaling between cells with distinct identities  
in both signaling events  n signals via a conserved mechanism that involves the cleavage and release from the membrane of the n intracellular domain that acts as a transcriptional co activator for dna binding proteins of the cbf1 suppressor of hairless lag 2  csl  family  2   
two transmembrane ligands of n are known in drosophila  delta  dl  and serrate  ser   3   
dl and ser have distinct functions  
some developmental decisions  however  require the activity of both genes  dl and ser are both required for the specification of wing margin cells during imaginal development  6 7 8 9 10   
consistent with this interpretation  dl and ser have been proposed to act redundantly in the sensory bristle lineage where they are co expressed   11   note  however  that results from another study have indicated a non redundant function for dl in the bristle lineage  12    
furthermore  dl and ser appear to be partially interchangeable because the forced expression of ser can partially rescue the dl neurogenic phenotype  13   
additionally  the ectopic expression of dl can partially rescue the ser wing phenotype  14   
the notion that dl and ser have similar signaling properties has  however  recently been challenged by the observation that human homologs of dl and ser have distinct instructive signaling activity  15   
endocytosis has recently emerged as a key mechanism regulating the signaling activity of dl  
first  clonal analysis in drosophila has suggested that dynamin dependent endocytosis is required not only in signal receiving cells but also in signal sending cells to promote n activation  16   
second  mutant dl proteins that are endocytosis defective exhibit reduced signaling activity  17   
third  two distinct e3 ubiquitin ligases  neuralized  neur  and mind bomb  mib   have recently been shown to regulate dl endocytosis and n activation in drosophila and danio rerio  respectively  18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   
ubiquitin is a 76 amino acid polypeptide that is covalently linked to substrates in a multi step process that involves a ubiquitin activating enzyme  e1   a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme  e2   and a ubiquitin   protein ligase  e3   
e3s recognize specific substrates and catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin to the protein substrate  
ubiquitin was first identified as a tag for proteins destined for degradation  
more recently  ubiquitin has also been shown to serve as a signal for endocytosis  26 27   
mib in d  rerio and neur in drosophila and xenopus have been shown to associate with dl  regulate dl ubiquitination  and promote its endocytosis  18 19 20 22 25 28   
moreover  genetic and transplantation studies have indicated that both neur and mib act in a non autonomous manner  18 21 22 23 25 29   indicating that endocytosis of dl is associated with increased dl signaling activity  
finally  epsin  a regulator of endocytosis that contains a ubiquitin interacting motif and that is known in drosophila as liquid facet  is essential for dl signaling  30 31   
in one study  liquid facet was proposed to target dl to an endocytic recycling compartment  suggesting that recycling of dl may be required for signaling  
how endocytosis of dl leads to the activation of n remains to be elucidated  
also  whether the signaling activity of ser is similarly regulated by endocytosis is not known  
neur and mib proteins completely differ in primary structure  
drosophila neur is a 754 amino acid protein that contains two conserved neur homology repeats of unknown function and one c terminal catalytic really interesting new gene  ring  domain  
d  rerio mib  also known as dip 1 in the mouse  32   is a 1 030 amino acid protein with one zz zinc finger domain surrounded by two mib herc2 domains  two mib repeats  eight ankyrin repeats  two atypical ring domains  and one c terminal catalytic ring domain  
both genes have been conserved from flies to mammals  18 19 33 34   
while genetic analysis has revealed that neur in drosophila and mib in d  rerio are strictly required for n signaling  knockout studies of mouse neur1 has indicated that neur1 is not strictly required for n signaling  33 34   
one possible explanation is functional redundancy with the mouse neur2 gene  
conversely  the function of drosophila mib  d mib   the homolog of d  rerio mib gene  is not known  
to establish the respective roles of these two distinct e3 ligases in the context of a single model organism  we have studied the function of the drosophila d mib gene  
we report here that d mib  like d  rerio mib  appears to regulate dl signaling during leg segmentation  wing vein formation  and lateral inhibition in the adult notum  
we further show that d mib is specifically required for ser endocytosis and signaling during wing development  indicating for the first time  to our knowledge  that endocytosis regulates ser signaling  
interestingly  the d mib activity was found necessary for a subset of n signaling events that are distinct from those requiring the activity of the neur gene  
nevertheless  the ectopic expression of neur compensates for the loss of d mib activity in the wing  indicating that neur and d mib have overlapping functions  
we conclude that d mib and neur are two structurally distinct proteins with similar molecular activities but distinct and complementary functions in drosophila  
results 
isolation of d mib mutations 
the closest drosophila homolog of the vertebrate mib gene is the predicted gene cg5841  d mib  18   
the d mib mutations identified are shown in figure 1  
a p element inserted into the 5  untranslated region of the d mib gene was recently isolated  http   flypush imgen bcm tmc edu pscreen    figure 1a   
insertion of this p element confers late pupal lethality  
lethality was reverted by precise excision of the p element  suggesting that insertion of this p element is a d mib mutation  referred to as d mib1  
a 13 6 kb deletion that removes the entire d mib coding region was selected by imprecise excision of this p element  
this deletion represents a null allele of d mib and was named d mib2  
this deletion also deletes the 3  flanking rps31 gene  figure 1a   
this indicates that these two lethal mutations are d mib mutant alleles  and they were therefore renamed d mib3 and d mib4  respectively  
the d mib1 and d mib3 mutations behave as genetic null alleles  see materials and methods   
in contrast  d mib4 is a partial loss of function allele because flies trans heterozygous for d mib4 and any other d mib null alleles are viable  
these four mutations identify the cg5841 gene as d mib by the following evidence  
first  lethality of homozygous d mib1 pupae is associated with the insertion of a p element into the 5  utr of the d mib gene  
second  genomic sequencing of the d mib3 allele revealed the presence of a stop codon at position 258  figure 1b   
this allele is therefore predicted to produce a truncated protein devoid of the catalytic ring domain  consistent with d mib3 being a null allele  
genomic sequencing of the d mib4 allele showed that this mutation is associated with a valine to methionine substitution at a conserved position in the second mib repeat  figure 1b   
thus  our analysis identified both complete and partial d mib loss of function alleles  
molecular and genetic characterization of d mib mutations

open reading frames are shown in black  
 b  domain composition of d mib and d  rerio mib  
both proteins show identical domain organization  
d mib has an n terminal zz zinc finger flanked on either side by a mib herc2  m h  domain  followed by two mib repeats  six ankyrin repeats  two atypical ring domains  and a c terminal protypical ring that has been associated with catalytic e3 ubiquitin ligase activity  
the d mib3 mutant allele is predicted to produce a truncated protein devoid of e3 ubiquitin ligase activity whereas the d mib4 protein carries a mutation at a conserved position in the second mib repeat

d mib regulates dl signaling 
complete loss of zygotic d mib activity in homozygous d mib1 and trans heterozygous d mib2 d mib3  d mib1 d mib3 and d mib1 d mib2 individuals led to late pupal lethality  
tissue losses were associated with a dramatic reduction in size of the eye field and of the wing pouch in mutant discs of third instar larvae  figure 2a   2e   
all these phenotypes may result from reduced n signaling  
indeed  a reduction in dl mediated lateral inhibition can result in ectopic sensory organs and increased bristle density on the body surface  
likewise  loss of dl signaling has been shown to result in short unsegmented legs  similar to the ones seen in the absence of d mib activity  figure 1m   whereas a complete loss of ser activity led to the formation of elongated unsegmented legs  figure 1n   36 37 38   
finally  the vein phenotype seen in d mib hypomorphic flies is similar to the one seen in dlts mutant flies  39   
together  these observations suggest that d mib regulates dl signaling in several developmental contexts  
consistent with this conclusion  we have shown that d mib binds dl and promotes dl signaling and that overexpression of d mib down regulates the accumulation of dl at the cell surface  e  c  lai  f  roegiers  x  qin  r  le borgne  f  schweisguth  et al   unpublished data

bar is 50  m in  b   e  and 20  m in  f and f    
d mib and neur have distinct functions 
we then studied in more detail the function of d mib during wing development  
growth of the wing pouch depends on the activity of an organizing center located at the dorsal ventral  d v  boundary  40 41   
this boundary is established in first instar larvae and is defined by the apterous expression boundary  
apterous activates the expression of the ser and fringe genes in dorsal cells  
high levels of ser in dorsal cells activate n in trans in ventral cells and suppress n activation in cis in dorsal cells  whereas fringe modifies n in dorsal cells such that dorsal cells located at the d v boundary respond to dl  
thus  composite signaling by ser and dl leads to symmetric n activation in margin cells located along the d v boundary  8 9 42 43   
n then regulates the expression of the vestigial and wingless  wg  genes that cooperate to promote growth of the wing pouch  
n also regulates expression of the cut gene in margin cells  44   
thus  loss of n signaling results in a reduction in size of the wing pouch accompanied by the loss of cut and wg expression along the d v boundary  
thus  the d mib wing phenotype may result from defective n inductive signaling at the d v boundary  
we conclude that the activity of the d mib gene is required for the specification of the wing margin and  hence  growth of the wing pouch  
we therefore conclude that d mib and neur have distinct and complementary functions in drosophila  
d mib co localizes with dl and ser at the apical cortex 
we next studied the subcellular localization of d mib  figure 3   
anti d mib antibodies were generated that specifically detected d mib on western blots  see figure 1c  and on fixed tissues  figure 3f   f    
using these antibodies  we found that d mib was detected in all imaginal disc cells  figure 3a and 3b   
we then examined d mib subcellular distribution in epithelial cells located along the edge of the wing discs because cross sectional imaging affords better resolution along the apical basal axis  
d mib co localized with ser  dl  and n at the apical cortex  figure 3b   3d      
dl and ser were also detected in large intracellular vesicles that probably correspond to multivesicular bodies in that they also stained for hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate  46   figure 3b   3c        data not shown   
the intracellular dots seen with the anti d mib antibodies were distinct from the dl  and ser positive dots and appeared to result from background staining  data not shown   
the reduced cytoplasmic staining seen in d mib mutant cells  figure 3f   3f      suggests that d mib is also present in the cytoplasm  
a similar localization at the apical cortex and in the cytoplasm was seen for a functional yellow fluorescent protein  yfp   d mib fusion protein  see figure 6 below   
these localization data suggest that d mib may act at the apical cortex to regulate the activity of dl and or ser

d mib is required in dorsal cells for margin expression of cut 
large dorsal clones of d mib2 mutant cells  marked by the loss of nuclear gfp  in green  resulted in a complete loss of cut  red  expression  a and b   
this indicates that d mib is required for ser signaling by dorsal cells  
low magnification views of the wing portion of the discs are shown in  a  and  c

d mib regulates the cell surface level of ser 
we next examined the potential role of d mib in regulating dl and ser distribution in wing imaginal discs  
dl and ser co localized both at the apical cortex and in large intracellular vesicles in wild type cells  figure 4a   4c    
in contrast  the accumulation of ser at the apical cortex was strongly increased  figure 4e  and ser accumulation in dl positive vesicles was dramatically reduced  figure 4e   in d mib1 mutant discs  
thus  trafficking of ser towards this intracellular compartment is  at least in part  d mib independent  
we therefore conclude that the d mib gene is required to regulate the level of ser at the apical cortex of wing disc cells  
d mib is required to down regulate ser at the apical cortex

d mib is required for ser endocytosis 
ubiquitin mediated endocytosis is thought to depend on monoubiquitination  
thus  by analogy with the function of mib in d  rerio  18 28   we suggest that d mib may directly monoubiquitinate ser  
consistent with this hypothesis  we show in a companion paper that d mib binds ser  e  c  lai  f  roegiers  x  qin  r  le borgne  f  schweisguth  et al   unpublished data   
moreover  a mutation in the c terminal catalytic ring domain of d mib abolished its ability to internalize ser in transfected s2 cells  r  l  b  and f  s   unpublished data  implying that the e3 ubiquitin ligase activity of d mib is required for ser internalization  
biochemical analysis of the ubiquitination events regulated by d mib will be needed to further define the mechanism by which d mib regulates the endocytosis of ser in vivo  
to test whether this specific increase in the level of ser at the apical cortex resulted from reduced ser endocytosis in d mib mutant cells  we followed the endocytosis of ser in living imaginal discs using an antibody uptake assay  
the uptake of anti ser and anti dl antibodies was then assessed using secondary antibodies  
the results are shown in figure 5  
using this assay  we found that anti ser and anti dl antibodies were internalized in wild type epithelial cells  figure 5a   5c     
however  the loss of d mib activity strongly inhibited the endocytosis of anti ser antibodies  figure 5e    
moreover  high levels of anti ser antibodies were seen at the apical surface  figure 5d  and 5f    confirming that d mib mutant cells accumulate high levels of ser at their surface  
we therefore conclude that d mib is specifically required for the endocytosis of ser in wing discs

d mib regulates ser signaling 
the regulation of ser endocytosis by d mib suggests that d mib may regulate ser signaling  
ser expression is restricted to dorsal cells in second instar wing imaginal discs  7 10 44 47 48   
ser in dorsal cells signals across the d v boundary to activate n in ventral cells  8 9   
if d mib is required for ser signaling during wing development  then loss of d mib activity in dorsal cells should affect the specification of the wing margin in a non autonomous manner  
loss of d mib activity in large dorsal clones of d mib2 mutant cells resulted in a loss of cut expression at the d v interface  figure 6a and 6b   
however  a narrowing of the cut positive margin was observed  figure 6d   suggesting that d mib contributes to regulating the level of dl signaling  
we next tested whether expression of d mib in dorsal cells is sufficient to rescue the d mib wing phenotype  
d mib was expressed in dorsal cells of d mib2 d mib3 mutant discs using ser gal4  
similarly to the expression of the ser gene  ser gal4 expression is restricted to dorsal cells in second early third instar larvae and is weakly expressed in ventral cells in mid late third instar larvae  i e   after margin cell specification  49 50   
expression of d mib in dorsal cells was sufficient to rescue growth of the wing pouch and of the expression of cut in margin cells in d mib mutant discs  figure 7a   
this result confirmed that d mib regulates ser signaling by dorsal cells  
a similar rescue was observed with a yfp  d mib protein  figure 7b   7b           indicating that yfp  d mib is functional  
yfp  d mib localized at the apical cortex and in the cytoplasm  figure 7c   7 d      as seen for endogenous d mib  see figure 3   
yfp  d mib co localized with dl and ser at the apical cortex of cells expressing low levels of yfp  d mib  
however  cells expressing high levels of yfp  d mib showed a strong reduction in the level of both dl and ser at the cortex  figure 7c   7c         further indicating that d mib down regulates the levels of both ser and dl at the apical cortex  e  c  lai  f  roegiers  x  qin  r  le borgne  f  schweisguth  et al   unpublished data   
expression of d mib in dorsal cells is sufficient to rescue the d mib mutant phenotype 
 a  expression of d mib  green  in dorsal cells  using ser gal4  rescued the growth of the wing pouch and margin cut  red  expression in d mib2 d mib3 mutant discs  
 b   d     ser gal4 driven expression of yfp  d mib  green  rescued the d mib2 d mib3 phenotype and strongly reduced the level of dl  blue in  b  b   c  c    d  and d     and ser  red in  b  b    c  c     d  and d      in dorsal cells

bar is 50  m for  a   b    and 10  m for  c   d      
d mib acts downstream of ser and upstream of activated n 
the functional assay was then used to genetically position the requirement for the d mib gene activity relative to ser and n  figure 8   
expression of an activated version of n  ncdc10  51   led to the activation of cut and promoted growth in dorsal cells of d mib2 d mib3 mutant discs  figure 8c   
this indicates that d mib acts at a step upstream of n activation  
this confirms that ser signaling requires the activity of the d mib gene  i e   that d mib acts downstream of ser  
expression of neur in dorsal cells is sufficient to rescue the d mib mutant phenotype 
by contrast  expression of ncdc10  an activated version of n  led to the deregulated growth of the dorsal compartment and the expression of cut in most dorsal cells  c   indicating that activated n acts downstream of d mib  
expression of neur in dorsal cells was sufficient to compensate for the loss of d mib activity  d   
bar is 40  m for all panels  
neur and d mib functions partially overlap 
the different requirements for neur and d mib gene activity may suggest that neur and d mib have distinct molecular activities  
alternatively  this difference may reflect a difference in gene expression  
by contrast  d mib appears to be uniformly expressed in imaginal discs  
to test this hypothesis  we examined whether the forced ubiquitous expression of the neur gene can suppress the d mib loss of function phenotype  
moreover  expression of neur in dorsal cells  using ser gal4  was sufficient to rescue growth of the wing pouch as well as the expression of cut in margin cells in d mib mutant discs  figure 8d   
we conclude that ectopic expression of neur compensates for the loss of d mib activity  
we therefore suggest that neur and d mib functions overlap but are not strictly identical  
discussion 
many recent studies have revealed that endocytosis plays multiple roles in the regulation of n signaling  reviewed in  2   see also  53 54    
here  we show that the conserved e3 ubiquitin ligases neur and d mib have similar molecular activities in the regulation of dl and ser endocytosis but distinct developmental functions in drosophila  
our analysis first establishes that d mib regulates ser signaling during wing development  
first  clonal analysis revealed that the activity of the d mib gene is specifically required in dorsal cells for the expression of cut at the wing margin  
second  expression of d mib in the dorsal ser signaling cells was sufficient to rescue the d mib mutant wing phenotype  
thus  an essential function of d mib in the wing is to regulate the endocytosis of ser in dorsal cells to non autonomously promote the activation of n along the d v boundary  
because d mib co localizes with ser at the apical cortex of wing disc cells  acts in a ring finger dependent manner to regulate ser endocytosis in s2 cells  r  l  b  and f  s   unpublished results   and physically associates with ser in co immunoprecipitation experiments  e  c  lai  f  roegiers  x  qin  r  le borgne  f  schweisguth  et al   unpublished data   d mib may ubiquitinate ser and directly regulate its endocytosis  
our analysis further suggests that endocytosis of ser is required for ser signaling  
thus  endocytosis of both n ligands appears to be strictly required for n activation in drosophila  
different models have been proposed to explain how endocytosis of the ligand  which removes the ligand from the cell surface  results in n receptor activation  discussed in  17 20 21 30    
we speculate that endocytosis of the ligands may have evolved as a means to ensure tight spatial regulation of the activation of n  
our analysis also establishes that the activity of the d mib gene is required for a subset of n signaling events that are distinct from those that require the activity of the neur gene  
the activity of the neur gene is also required for lateral inhibition during neurogenesis in embryos and pupae  4 45 61   
this process is largely independent of d mib gene activity since the complete loss of d mib function only resulted in a mild neurogenic phenotype in the notum  
these data thus indicate that the neur and d mib genes have largely distinct and complementary functions in drosophila  
whether a similar functional relationship between neur and d mib exists in vertebrates awaits the study of the d  rerio neur genes and or of the murine mib and neur genes  
first  both neur and d mib physically interact with dl   20   e  c  lai  f  roegiers  x  qin  r  le borgne  f  schweisguth  et al   unpublished data  and promote the down regulation of dl from the apical membrane when overexpressed  e  c  lai  f  roegiers  x  qin  r  le borgne  f  schweisguth  et al   unpublished data   
furthermore  dl signaling appears to require the activity of either neur or d mib  depending on the developmental contexts  
consistent with this interpretation  overexpression studies indicate that d mib up regulates the signaling activity of dl  whereas a dominant negative form of d mib inhibits it  e  c  lai  f  roegiers  x  qin  r  le borgne  f  schweisguth  et al   unpublished data   
it is conceivable that the contribution of d mib to the endocytosis of dl is masked by the activity of d mib independent processes that may  or may not  be linked to dl signaling  
we have also shown that  reciprocally  neur and d mib may similarly regulate ser  
neur and d mib were shown to similarly promote down regulation of ser from the cell surface when overexpressed  e  c  lai  f  roegiers  x  qin  r  le borgne  f  schweisguth  et al   unpublished data   
moreover  d mib binds ser  e  c  lai  f  roegiers  x  qin  r  le borgne  f  schweisguth  et al   unpublished data  and regulates ser signaling  this study   
whether endogenous neur binds and activates ser remains to be tested  
however  the ability of neur to rescue the d mib mutant wing phenotype when expressed in dorsal cells strongly indicates that neur can promote ser signaling  
together  these data indicate that neur and d mib have similar molecular activities  
d mib and neur may have identical molecular activities but distinct expression patterns  hence distinct functions at the level of the organism  
consistent with this possibility  d mib is uniformly distributed in imaginal discs  whereas neur is specifically detected in sensory cells  52   
importantly  the rescue of the d mib mutant phenotype by ectopic expression of neur strongly supports this interpretation  
this result further suggests that neur can regulate ser signaling  
thus  despite their obvious structural differences  neur and d mib appear to act similarly to promote the endocytosis of dl and ser  
in conclusion  neur and d mib appear to have similar molecular activities in the regulation of dl and ser endocytosis but distinct developmental functions in drosophila  
the conservation from drosophila to mammals of these two structurally distinct but functionally similar e3 ubiquitin ligases is likely to reflect a combination of evolutionary advantages associated with   i  specialized expression pattern  as evidenced by the cell specific expression of the neur gene in sensory organ precursor cells  52    ii  specialized function  as suggested by the role of murine mib in tnf   signaling  32    iii  regulation of protein stability  localization  and or activity

rag1 core and v d j recombination signal sequences were derived from transib transposons 
abstract 
the v d j recombination reaction in jawed vertebrates is catalyzed by the rag1 and rag2 proteins  which are believed to have emerged approximately 500 million years ago from transposon encoded proteins  
here we show that the approximately 600 amino acid    core    region of rag1 required for its catalytic activity is significantly similar to the transposase encoded by dna transposons that belong to the transib superfamily  
this superfamily was discovered recently based on computational analysis of the fruit fly and african malaria mosquito genomes  
transib transposons also are present in the genomes of sea urchin  yellow fever mosquito  silkworm  dog hookworm  hydra  and soybean rust  
we demonstrate that recombination signal sequences  rsss  were derived from terminal inverted repeats of an ancient transib transposon  
furthermore  the critical dde catalytic triad of rag1 is shared with the transib transposase as part of conserved motifs  
we also studied several divergent proteins encoded by the sea urchin and lancelet genomes that are 25  30  identical to the rag1 n terminal domain and the rag1 core  
our results provide the first direct evidence linking rag1 and rsss to a specific superfamily of dna transposons and indicate that the v d j machinery evolved from transposons  
we propose that only the rag1 core was derived from the transib transposase  whereas the n terminal domain was assembled from separate proteins of unknown function that may still be active in sea urchin  lancelet  hydra  and starlet sea anemone  
introduction 
the immune system of jawed vertebrates detects and destroys foreign invaders  including bacteria and viruses  by a specific response to an unlimited number of antigens expressed by them  
the antigens can be identified after they are specifically bound by surface receptors of vertebrate b and t immune cells  bcrs and tcrs  respectively   
the variable portions of the bcr and tcr genes are composed of separate v  variable   d  diversity   and j  joining  segments  which are represented by fewer than a few hundred copies each  
in a b and t cell site specific recombination reaction  commonly known as v d j recombination  one v  one d  and one j segment are joined together into a single exon encoding the variable antigen binding region of the receptor  
in addition to this combinatorial diversity  further diversity is generated by small insertions and deletions at junctions between the joined segments  
in v d j recombination  dna cleavage is catalyzed by two proteins encoded by the recombination activating genes  approximately 1040 amino acid  aa  rag1 and approximately 530 aa rag2  2 3   
the site specificity of the recombination is defined by the binding of rag1 2 to rsss flanking the v  d  and j segments  4   
all rsss can be divided into two groups  referred to as rss12 and rss23  and consist of conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by a variable spacer either 12    1  rss12  or 23    1  rss23  bp long  4   7   
during v d j recombination  rag1 2 complex binds one rss12 and one rss23  bringing them into juxtaposition  and cuts the chromosome between the rss heptamers and the corresponding v and d  d and j  or v and j coding segments  3 8   
a rule requiring that efficient v d j recombination occur between rss12 and rss23 is known as the    12 23    rule  1   
even prior to the discovery of rag1 and rag2  it had been suggested that the first two rsss were originally terminal inverted repeats  tirs  of an ancient transposon whose accidental insertion into a gene ancestral to bcr and tcr  followed by gene duplications  triggered the emergence of the v d j machinery  4   
later  this model was expanded by the suggestion that both rag1 and rag2 might have evolved from a transposase  tpase  that catalyzed transpositions of ancient transposons flanked by tirs that were precursors of rsss  9   
this model has received additional support through observations of similar biochemical reactions in transposition and v d j recombination  10 11   
finally  it was demonstrated that rag1 2 catalyzed transpositions of a dna segment flanked by rss12 and rss23 in vitro  12 13  and in vivo in yeast  14   
in vertebrates  in vivo rag mediated transpositions are strongly suppressed  probably to minimize potential harm to genome function  
so far  only one putative instance of such a transposition has been reported  15   
here we demonstrate that the rag1 core and rsss were derived from a tpase and tirs encoded by ancient dna transposons from the transib superfamily  17   
the transib superfamily is one of ten superfamilies of dna transposons detected so far in eukaryotes  17   
like other dna transposons  transib transposons exist as autonomous and nonautonomous elements  
the autonomous transib transposons are 3   4 kb long and code for an approximately 700 aa tpase that is not similar to tpases from any other transposon superfamilies  
computational analysis of transib elements  including their numerous insertions into copies of other transposons  demonstrated that transib transposons are flanked by 5 bp target site duplications  tsds   which also distinguishes this superfamily from all the others  17   
transib transpositions are expected to be catalyzed by the binding of the tpase to tirs of autonomous and nonautonomous transposons  17   
as discussed in this paper  in addition to the fruit fly  drosophila melanogaster  and african malaria mosquito  anopheles gambiae  genomes  in which transib transposons were originally discovered  these genes are also present in diverse animals  table s1   including other species of fruit fly  e g   drosophila pseudoobscura  drosophila willistoni   yellow fever mosquito  anopheles aegypti   silkworm  bombyx mori   red flour beetle  tribolium castaneum   dog hookworm  ancylostoma caninum   freshwater flatworm  schmidtea mediterranea   hydra  hydra magnipapillata   sea urchin  strongylocentrotus purpuratus   and soybean rust  phakopsora pachyrhizi   
genomes of plants and vertebrates seem to be free of any recognizable transib transposons  figure 1

detection of similarity between transib tpases and rag1 
using protein sequences of seven known transib tpases  transib1 through transib4 and transib1_ag through transib3_ag from d  melanogaster and a  gambiae  respectively   17  as queries in a standard blastp search against all genbank proteins  we found that the approximately 60 aa c terminal portion of the transib2_ag tpase was 35  38  identical to the c terminal portion of the rag1 core  figure s1   
however  this similarity was only marginally significant  e   0 07 where the e value is an expected number of sequences matching by chance  table 1   
in another search against genbank  using psi blast  18   see materials and methods  with the transib2_ag tpase as a query  we found that two unclassified proteins  genbank gi 30923617 and 30923765  annotated as hypothetical proteins  and rag1s constituted the only group of any genbank proteins similar to the transib2_ag tpase  table 1   
the statistical significance of similarity between the tpase and rag1s was measured by ei   0 025  where ei is the e value threshold for the first inclusion of rag1 sequences into the psi blast iterations  18   materials and methods   
the observed improvement in significance of the transib rag1 similarity  from e   0 07 in blastp to ei   0 025 in psi blast  table 1  was due to the fact that both 151 aa and 123 aa hypothetical genbank proteins were apparent remnants of transib tpases  approximately 40  identity to the transib2_ag tpase  e   10 10 in blastp   
the rag1 proteins appeared to be more similar to the position specific scoring matrix  pssm  created by psi blast based on multiple alignment of the transib2_ag tpase and two transib tpase like proteins  than to the solo transib2_ag tpase in the blastp search  
given the latter observation  we decided to improve the quality of the pssm constructed by psi blast for different transib tpase sequences  
to achieve that  we combined protein sequences of the seven known transib tpases with the set of all genbank proteins  
as a result  ei values for matches of rag1s to a new pssm based on alignment of nine transib tpases  the two genbank tpase like proteins plus seven added tpases  noticeably dropped in comparison with the ei values obtained for the pssm constructed in the previous step based on alignment of the three tpases  table 1   
to support the observation that ei values of matches between rag1s and the transib tpase pssm decrease as the number of tpase sequences used for construction of the pssm increases  we identified six new transib tpases  transib5  transib3_dp  transib4_dp  transib1_aa  transib2_aa  transib3_aa  figure s2   
during the next step of the psi blast analysis  the original genbank set was combined with 13 transib tpases  
again  ei values of matches between rag1s and the new pssm derived from multiple alignment of 15 transib tpases  the two genbank proteins plus all our tpases  were much smaller  approximately 10 6   10 3  table 1  than those obtained based on the pssm constructed from the nine tpases at the preceding step  approximately 10 3   10 2   
in the final step  we identified one more set of five new transib tpases  transib1_dp  transib2_dp  transib4_aa  transib5_aa  and transib1_sp   
when all 18 tpases were combined with the original genbank set  the ei values of matches between rag1s and the transib pssm dropped significantly further  10 9   10 4  table 1   
during the final revision of this manuscript  we identified an intermediate rag1 like sequence in hydra magnipapillata  called rag1l_hm  which is significantly similar to both rag1 and transib tpase  as shown later  
this direct result represents an independent validation of our analysis  
the psi blast pssm of transib tpases approximates conservation variability of the transib tpase consensus sequence  
the more diverse the tpases used in determining the pssm  the more accurate is the approximation  some of the insect transib tpases are less than 30  identical to each other  as shown in figure 2  
the rag1 ei values decreased as the number of transib tpases used for the pssm construction increased due to the fact that rag1 evolved from a transib tpase  
in all cases  the e values obtained after several rounds of iterations were less than 10 20 at the point of convergence  
nearly the entire sequences of several transib tpases  excluding their 100   140 aa n terminal domains  converged with an approximately 600 aa portion of rag1 defined by positions approximately 360   1010  figure s3   
this portion of rag1 corresponds to the    rag1 core     hereafter numbered relative to human rag1  residues 387   1011   which along with rag2 is known to be sufficient to perform v d j cleavage even after deletions of the 383 aa n terminal and 32 aa c terminal portions of rag1  19 20   
during studies reported here  we identified 11 additional new families of transib transposons and tpases  see figure s2  that are well preserved in the genomes of fruit flies  transib5 in d  melanogaster  and transib1_dp  transib2_dp  transib3_dp  and transib4_dp in d  pseudoobscura   mosquitoes  transib1_aa  transib2_aa  transib3_aa  transib4_aa  and transib5_aa from a  aegypti  and sea urchin  transib1_sp   
transib1_sp is the first transib transposon identified outside of insect genomes  
a well preserved 4132 bp transib1_sp element  contig 7839  positions 376   4506  is flanked by a 5 bp cggcg tsd  and it encodes a 676 aa tpase  two exons  that is most similar to the transib2 tpase  34  identity   
based on the currently available sequence data  we also reconstructed portions of tpases that were missed in previous studies  17   materials and methods  see figure s2   
using the transib1_sp tpase as a query in tblastn searches against all genbank sections  nr  htgs  wgs  dbgss  dbest  dbsts  and trace archives  we also found diverse transib tpases in silkworm  red flour beetle  dog hookworm  freshwater flatworm  soybean rust  and hydra  table s1   
the observed patchy distribution could be caused by horizontal transfers and extinctions of transib transposons in eukaryotic species

common structural hallmarks of the transib tpase and rag1 core 
all three core residues from the catalytic dde triad in the rag1 proteins  residues 603  711  and 965  that are necessary for v d j recombination  21 22  are conserved in the transib tpases  figures 3 and figure s3   
this includes the distances between the second d and e residues  which are much longer in transib transposons  206   214 aa  and rag1  253 aa  than in dde tpases from other studied superfamilies  e g   approximately 35 aa in mariner tc1  23   2 aa in p  23   approximately 35 aa in harbinger  24   with hat as an exception  325 aa   25    
moreover  each catalytic residue is a part of a motif that is conserved in the transib tpases and rag1  motifs 4  6  and 10 in figures 3 and figure s3   
the rag1 core is composed of the n terminal region and the central and c terminal domains   26 27   
the n terminal region includes the rss nonamer binding regions  residues 387   480   referred to as nbr  28 29   
the two terminal motifs of rag1 nbr are conserved in the transib tpases  figure s3   which indicates that they may be important for their binding to the transib tirs during transposition  the rss like structure of tirs is described below  figure 4   
the central domain of the rag1 core  residues 531   763  includes two aspartic acid residues from the dde triad and is also thought to be involved in binding to the rss heptamer and rag2  30 31   
the c terminal domain of rag1  residues 764   1011  is the portion of rag1 that is most conserved between rag1 and transib tpases  
in addition to the catalytic activity attributed to the last residue of the dde triad  this domain has a strong nonspecific dna binding affinity because it binds to coding dna upstream of the rss heptamer  and is thought to be involved in rag1 dimerization  26 27   
this domain is predicted to function analogously in transib transposons  
several other motifs conserved in transib tpases and rag1 include aa residues that have been shown experimentally to be important for specific functions in v d j recombination  figure s3   
based on this information  the function of these motifs in transib tpases is expected to be similar to that in rag1  
among the most conserved motifs  motif 5  see figures 3 and figure s3  is of particular interest because its function is not known yet but is expected to play a role both v d j recombination and transib transposition  
in conjunction with detailed studies of the transib superfamily  we also analyzed the remaining nine known superfamilies of dna transposons defined by diverse tpases  see table 1 in  24    
some of these tpases  including mariner  harbinger  p  and hat  also contain the catalytic dde triad  23   
therefore  given that the only significant similarity of the rag1 core was to the transib tpase  the rag1 core was re confirmed as belonging to the transib superfamily  
in addition to the statistically significant similarity between the approximately 600 aa rag1 core and transib tpases  there are two other lines of evidence suggesting evolution of the v d j machinery from transib dna transposons  
they include the characteristic tsds and structure of the tirs discussed in the next two sections

the 5  tirs of these transposons are aligned with the corresponding 3  tirs  
structures of the 5  and 3  tirs resemble rss12 and rss23  respectively  
similar length of tsds and target site composition in transib and rag1 2 mediated transpositions 
it has been known that rag1 mediated transposition in vitro  both intermolecular and intramolecular  is most frequently accompanied by 5 bp tsds  12 13   
in one study  12   35 of 38  92   tsds generated during rag mediated intermolecular transposition were 5 bp long  and the remaining 8  were either 4 or 3 bp long  
also  69  of 36 tsds recovered during rag mediated intramolecular transpositions were 5 bp in length  of the remaining ones  28  were 4 bp and 3  were 3 bp long  
in another study  13   six of six tsds detected in the intermolecular transposition were 5 bp long  
intramolecular transposition mediated by murine rag1 2 proteins was also studied recently in vivo in yeast  14   
again  60  of tsds recovered in 26 events were 5 bp long  14   
given the predominance of 5 bp tsds  it is striking that transib transposons belong to the only superfamily of eukaryotic dna transposons with 5 bp tsds generated upon insertions into the genome  17 24   
to illustrate the characteristic 5 bp tsds  we show copies of transib transposons with intact 5  and 3  tirs from diverse families of transib transposons present in the d  melanogaster  d  pseudoobscura  a  gambiae  and s  purpuratus genomes  figure s4   
moreover  some families show high target site specificity  e g   transib n1_ag and transib n2_ag integrate preferentially at ccastgg and ccawtgc  respectively  tsds are capitalized   
rag1 2 mediated transpositions also show significant target specificity  presumably reflecting the original specificity of the transib tpase  12   
both rag1 2 mediated and transib transpositions show strong preference for gc rich target sites  12   14 32   even though genomes hosting transib transposons are at rich  figure s4  table 2   
structure of transib tirs 
the structure and conservation patterns of the 38 bp termini of transib transposons from 21 different families closely resemble those of rsss  suggesting that the latter were derived from termini of ancient transib transposons  figures 4 and s4   
the 38 bp consensus tir of transib transposons consists of a conserved 5   cacaatg heptamer separated by a variable 23 bp spacer from an aaaaaaatc 3  nonamer  
this corresponds closely to the structure of rsss  which are composed of the conserved heptamers 5   cacagtg separated by a variable 22 bp spacers from acaaaaacc like nonamers  1 5   7   
only bases at positions 1 through 3 in the heptamer and at positions 5 and 6 in the nonamer are universally conserved in rsss and absolutely essential for efficient v d j recombination  5   7   
the corresponding positions are perfectly conserved in all transib transposons  figure 4a and 4b  excluding the 85  conserved position 34 in the transib consensus that corresponds to position 5 in the rss nonamer   
the probability of the observed match between the rss and transib termini to occur by chance is less than 10 3  see materials and methods   
although most transib families are represented by transposons flanked by tirs similar to rss23  figure 4a   several families include transposons with 5  and 3  termini similar to rss12 and rss23  respectively  figure 4c   
therefore  even the 12 23 rule  1  can be derived directly from the sequence structure of known transib transposons  
rag1 core   like sequences in the sea urchin  lancelet  starlet sea anemone  and hydra genomes 
using rag1 proteins as query sequences in a wu blast search against sea urchin contigs sequenced at baylor college  see materials and methods   we identified eight proteins approximately 30  identical to portions of the rag1 core and approximately 50  identical to each other  see figures 2  5  and s5   
only one protein is present in two copies  which are 94  identical to each other at the dna level  contigs 81987 and 6797   
both copies appear to be encoded by pseudogenes damaged by a stop codon at the same position of each protein  
interestingly  the 6 690 bp contig 6797 harbours two additional defective pseudogenes coding for different rag1 core   like proteins  figure 5   
we also identified a 597 aa protein sequence encoded by a single open reading frame  contig 29068  positions 1157   2944   which is 28  identical to nearly the entire rag1 core  positions 461   1002 in the human rag1  figure s5   
using fgenesh  33   we detected that the rag1 core   like open reading frame  orf  in the contig 29068 forms a terminal exon  positions 1154   2947  of an incomplete hypothetical gene composed of two exons  internal and terminal  see figure s6   
the 3  terminal portion of the internal exon encodes a protein sequence that appears to be marginally similar to an approximately 50 aa fragment of the rag1 core  positions 394   454 in human rag1  figure s5   
the rag1 core   like protein in whole genome shotgun  wgs  contig 12509  figure 5  also seems to be encoded by the last exon starting at position 1650 of a hypothetical rag1 like gene  
remarkably  the acceptor splice site positions in the sea urchin rag1 core   like proteins closely correspond to those in rag1 from teleosts  i e   most of the living ray finned or bony fish   in which rag1 is split by an intron at position homologous to gly460 in human rag1  34   
using the same rag1 query sequences in a tblastn search against wgs trace sequences from the lancelet  branchiostoma floridae  genome recently sequenced at the joint genome institute  see materials and methods   we found that the lancelet genome encodes protein sequences approximately 35  identical to the rag1 core  figure s5  rag1l_bf  blastp e value is equal to 10 34   
however  unlike highly conserved rag1 proteins  the rag1 core   like proteins are remarkably diverse  see figure 2   
during the second review of the manuscript of this article  we were kindly informed by dr  
herv   philippe of a rag1 core   like sequence present the starlet sea anemone  nematostella vectensis   
after that  we screened all available trace archives  materials and methods  and detected additional rag1 like proteins  
in starlet sea anemone  several approximately 1000 bp wgs trace sequences were found  e g   genbank trace archive ids 668021618  558173651  568641192  and 599572062   which encode protein  called rag1l_nv  that is approximately 30  identical to the human rag1 core  positions 284   802  tblastn  10 26   e   10 7   
we also found several approximately 1000 bp wgs trace sequences of hydra magnipapillata  trace archive ids 688654311  647073738  666995387  687186526  688683890  and 688948453   coding for protein sequences 26  30  identical to the rag1 core  positions 753 995  e value is approximately equal to 10 7 in a blastx search against genbank   
using these trace sequences  we partially assembled a hydra gene  called rag1l_nm  which encodes the rag1 core   like protein  
remarkably  the hydra rag1l_nm protein turned out to be significantly similar to the transib tpase  26  identity  e value is approximately equal to 10 14 in a blastx search against genbank proteins combined with the transib tpase sequences   
therefore  the hydra rag1 core   like protein provides the first direct link between the rag1 core and transib tpase

n terminal   like domain of rag1 in the sea urchin  lancelet  starlet sea anemone  and hydra genomes 
a separate analysis of the assembled sea urchin sequences yielded seven sequences encoding three diverse proteins that were significantly similar to the 380 aa n terminal domain of rag1  blastx  e   10 4   excluding the 100 aa n terminus  figure 6   
the first 305 aa protein is encoded by contig 1226  and its recently duplicated copies are on contigs 1219 and 1222  approximately 95  identical to each other at the protein level   
the second  195 aa protein  contig 83099  is the shortest  
it is only approximately 26  identical to the first protein and more than 90  identical at the dna level to its duplicate on contig 86231  
we also found a third protein on contig 768 that contains unique motifs in its n terminal regions that best match the homologous regions of rag1  
furthermore  we found that unassembled wgs trace sequences encode two other proteins  p4_sp and p5_sp  similar to the n terminal rag1 domain  figure 6   
by analyzing the lancelet wgs traces  we also found that the lancelet genome encodes five different proteins similar to the n terminal domain of rag1  blastp e values in searches against all genbank proteins were in a range of 10 14   10 7   
dna sequences coding for these proteins  p1_bf through p5_bf  were manually assembled from overlapping wgs sequences  data available upon request   
the proteins detected in the sea urchin and lancelet genome share a ring finger motif as well as two novel motifs matching the n terminal rag1 domain  figure 6  and remotely resembling c x2 c zinc finger motifs  
the new conserved motifs are h x3 l x3 c r x c g and d x3 i h p x2 f c x2 c  and their function remains to be determined  
it is thought that the ring finger motif of rag1 functions as a zinc binding domain  is involved in dimerization  30 35   and acts as an e3 ligase in the ubiquitylation  36   
it also likely that the n terminal rag1 and rag1 like proteins share an additional conserved motif w x p h x 3   6  c x2 c that resides between conserved motif 2 and the ring finger  figure 6   
none of the sea urchin and lancelet proteins align to the approximately 100 aa n terminus of rag1  which may indicate that this portion is missing from the genome or highly diverged and difficult to detect  
it is also worth noting that this portion corresponds to a separate exon in some teleosts  see discussion   
the ring finger motif itself is also present in several sea urchin proteins unrelated to rag1 but significantly similar to diverse proteins associated with immune and developmental systems as well as regulation of transcription  
to test whether the reported sea urchin sequences represent a true rag1 like match  we cut off the ring finger motif and repeated the blastp search against all genbank proteins  
blastp e values were 9  10 9  7  10 5  and 10 3 for the p5_sp  p4_sp  and 768_sp sequences  respectively  because both the low complexity filter and composition based statistics were applied  the corresponding e values were estimated very conservatively  
the only exception was the already mentioned sea anemone rag1 core   like sequence  
the approximately 90 aa n terminus of the latter sequence is the ring finger  e   10 7  multiple blastp matches against known ring fingers in genbank

discussion 
the significant similarity between the transib tpases and rag1 core  the common structure of the transib tirs and rsss  as well as the similar size of tsds characterizing transpositions of transib transposons and transpositions catalyzed by rag1 and rag2  directly support the 25 year old hypothesis of a transposon related origin of the v d j machinery  
previously  the    rag transposon    hypothesis was open to challenge by alternative models of convergent evolution  
these arguments can now be put to rest  
as shown in this paper  the rag1 core was derived from a transib tpase  but given the low identity between the transib tpase and the rag1 core  14    17   it is not clear whether the ancestral transposon was a member of the group of canonical transib transposons preserved in modern genomes of insects  hydra  and sea urchin  see figure 1   or a member of an unknown group of transib transposons that encoded a tpase that was more similar to rag1 core than to the canonical tpase from the currently known transib transposons  
furthermore  after its recruitment  the rag1 core most likely went through a period of intensive transformations due to diversifying positive selection  which further decreased its similarity to transib tpase  
afterwards  the rag1 genes continued to evolve at a slow and steady pace under stabilizing selection  as indicated by the observed conservation of the rag1 core  79  identity between sharks and mammals   
some of the intermediate stages of rag1 evolution can be inferred from analysis of the sea urchin in which rag1 like proteins were recently observed  37   and from analysis of the lancelet  starlet sea anemone  and hydra genomes  
based on the presence of stop codons disrupting some of the rag1 like sequences  it has been suggested  37  that the sea urchin sequences represent remnants of transposable elements  
typically  tpase coding autonomous dna transposons are present in only a few complete copies per genome  
at the same time  sequences homologous to their terminal portions  including specific tirs  are usually abundant due to the proliferation of nonautonomous dna transposons fueled by the tpase expressed by the corresponding low copy autonomous elements  
therefore  even if only 30  of the sea urchin genome has been sequenced to date  it is expected that the regions flanking the tpase portions of potential autonomous elements should be similar to numerous nonautonomous elements  
detailed analysis of regions flanking the sea urchin rag1 like dna coding sequences revealed a variety of different transposable elements inserted in the proximity of the coding sequences  see figure 5   
still  given that only one third of the sea urchin genome is currently assembled as a set of contigs longer than several thousand nucleotides  the remaining portion is represented by short wgs sequences   we cannot rule out the possibility that the sea urchin rag1 like proteins are remnants of an unknown branch of transib transposons  
given that the genomes of lancelet  hydra  and starlet sea anemone are currently available only as unassembled wgs traces  the question whether the corresponding rag1 like sequences are remnants of transposons or genes pseudogenes must be left open  
the alternative possibility is that the sea urchin rag1 core   like sequences represent diverse genes and pseudogenes that belong to a rapidly evolving multigene family  
this opens the tantalizing possibility that the rag1 core was recruited from a transib tpase in a common ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians  and subsequently lost in nematodes  insects  and sea squirts  see figure 1   
furthermore  given that the sea urchin  lancelet  hydra  and starlet sea anemone genomes harbor several highly divergent n terminal   like domains  separate from the rag1 core   like sequences and known transposable elements  it is very likely that the n terminal   like domains of rag1 also form a multigene family that can be traced back to a common ancestor of deuterostomes  see figure 1   
if so  then both n terminal and core domains of rag1 might have been derived from different genes present in a common ancestor of deuterostomes  
alternatively  the n terminal domain of rag1 might have been derived from a separate  unknown transposon  
the only notable exception is the anemone rag1 core   like protein sequence  which is capped by the 90 aa ring finger motif  
taken together with the fact that only the rag1 core is significantly similar to transib tpase  the data suggest that the vertebrate rag1 represents a fusion of once separate proteins  
this is consistent with the observation that in teleosts   bony fish  the rag1 gene is divided into exons by either one or two introns  
as a result  the rag1 core is split into separate exons at the aa position that corresponds to position 460 in the human rag1gene  29 34 38   
the core like sequences encoded by the sea urchin wgs sequence contigs 29068 and 12509 correspond to either the second or third rag1 exon in teleosts  depending on the number of introns   which is remarkably consistent with the fusion model  
the same model predicts that the n terminal domain of rag1 could also be assembled from two separate domains based on the presence of the second intron in some teleosts  splitting the n terminal domain into the 102 aa n terminal subdomain and the rest  34   
as indicated above  this subdomain  corresponding to the first exon in the genes split by two introns  appears to be missing in the sea urchin  lancelet  hydra  and starlet sea anemone n terminal   like proteins  
it may be encoded by a separate exon that is difficult to detect given its short length and the high level of sequence divergence between these species and vertebrates  or it might have been added in vertebrates  
similarly  the rag1 core   like protein in the sea urchin genome is shorter in its n terminal part than the core domain in vertebrates and the corresponding transib tpase  
it is currently believed that both rag1 and rag2 proteins were originally encoded by the same transposon recruited in a common ancestor of jawed vertebrates  3 12 13 16   
autonomous dna transposons from the mudr  harbinger  and en spm superfamilies are each known to encode a second regulatory protein  23 24   whereas some transposons from these superfamilies encode the tpase only  
therefore  it is in principle possible that an ancient vertebrate transib that was a direct ancestor of the rag1 core also encoded a second protein  the direct ancestor of rag2  
if so  detailed studies of individual components  including active transib transposons and invertebrate proteins homologous to rag1 elements can bring new breakthroughs in our understanding of evolutionary and mechanistic aspects of v d j recombination  
the observed sequence similarity between the rag1 and transib tpase protein can help to identify aa residues in the tpase that are crucial for transposition of transib transposons  
for instance  on the basis of the tpase comparison to rag1  see figures s1 and s3   we were able to identify correct positions of the last two aa residues in the dde catalytic triad  see figure 2 in  17    missed in our previous study due to insufficient data  
interestingly  only two cysteines of the zinc finger b  zfb  c2h2 motif in rag1  residues 695   761  involved in its binding to rag2  30 31  are perfectly conserved in the transib tpases  motif 7  see figures 3 and figure s3   
notably  two zfb cysteines are part of the conserved sxxcxxc motif  and mutations of the serine from the same motif cause severe defects in rag1 transpositions in vitro  32   
therefore  the presence of serine in this motif is expected to be crucial to transib transpositions  
after submission of our manuscript  additional biochemical evidence favoring evolution of v d j recombination from transposable elements was reported  25   
analogously to v d j recombination  transposition of the fly hermes transposon  which belongs to the hat superfamily  is also characterized by a double strand break via hairpin formation on flanking dna and 3  oh joining to the target dna  25   
second  although rag1 2 mediated transpositions are characterized by 5 bp  sometimes 4 bp  tsds  all known hat transposons are characterized by 8 bp tsds  
third  unlike in the case of transib transposons  tirs of hat transposons are different from rss both in terms of dna sequence similarities and their conservation patterns  figure s7   
fourth  hat  and rag1 2 mediated transpositions differ dramatically in terms of the gc content of their target sites  unlike transib transposons and rag1 transpositions occurring in gc rich dna  hat transposons tend to be integrated into at rich regions  table s2   
all four arguments strongly favor evolution of v d j machinery from a transib transposon  
most likely  the transib transpositions are also characterized by hairpin intermediates formed by the ends of the donor dna double strand breaks  as observed during v d j recombination and hat transposition

sequence analysis  
computer assisted identification and reconstruction of the transib transposons was done as described previously  17 40   42   
dna sequence analysis including local sequence alignments  multiple alignments  and reconstruction of the transib consensus sequences was done using software developed at genetic information research institute  available upon request  and wu blastn 2 0  http   blast wustl edu   
to avoid background noise introduced by mutations  transib relics  whose tpase coding regions contained numerous stop codons and indels  were ignored unless several copies were available  
 we included in the analysis incomplete relics of the transib2   5_aa tpases represented by single dna copies   
prediction of putative exons and introns encoded by the transib consensus sequences was done with fgenesh  33   at http   www softberry com   
multiple alignments of distantly related rag1 and transib tpase protein sequences were created by t coffee  40   
shading and minor manual refinements of the aligned sequences were done using genedoc  43   
phylogenetic trees were produced by using mega3  44   
some of the sea urchin sequences encoding the rag1 n terminal domain were assembled from traces based on the baylor bac fisher server at http   www hgsc bcm tmc edu bac fisher   the results of assembly were verified manually   
all genbank proteins were downloaded from ftp   ftp ncbi nih gov blast db fasta nr  february 2004  and were combined into a single set with the identified transib tpases  
these proteins are apparent fragments of transib tpases encoded by relics of transib transposons  including transib5_dm  
a standalone 2001 version of psi  position specific iterating  blast  18 45  was used for detection of proteins that were significantly similar to tpases encoded by transib and other superfamilies of dna transposons  
the psi blast program  18 45  is much more sensitive than a regular blast search due to the use of pssm  psi blast first performs a standard blastp search of a protein query against a protein database and constructs a multiple alignment of matches exceeding a certain e value threshold  called ei value for the inclusion of sequences into psi blast iterations   
from this alignment  a pssm is constructed  
the pssm is a weight matrix indicating the relative occurrence of each of the 20 aa at each position in the alignment  
this new pssm is used as the score matrix for a new blast search in a second iteration  
the use of a pssm in place of a fixed generic substitution matrix such as blosum62 results in a much more sensitive blast search  18 45   
important practical aspects of using psi blast were recently described  46   
in this procedure we studied dependence of ei values on the number of the transib tpases combined with the genbank proteins  
significant convergence of rag1 and transib tpases was observed to be independent of the particular type of substitution matrix  the same result was observed for both blosum62 and pam70 matrixes   
to avoid detection of false similarities caused by simple repeats and coiled coils  the psi blast search was performed using stringent conditions with the seg  47  and coils  48  filters masking all low complexity regions and coiled coils  respectively  composition based statistics  45  were also employed  
the probability p1 that the 5  terminus of a transposon from a particular transib family would match by chance an rss at its most conserved positions  positions 1 3 in the rss heptamer  and positions 5 and 6 in the rss nonamer  was estimated based on the following formula  p1   fc    fa    fc    fa    fa  where fc  0 2  and fa  0 3  are frequencies of c and a in a set of 38 bp 5  termini of transib transposons from 21 families  see figure 4   
the value of p1 is 0 001  indicating a significant similarity between transib tirs and rss  
indeed  given that these five positions conserved in rss are conserved in all tirs from 21 families of transib transposons  and the average identity between these 38 bp tirs is only 49   the chance of randomly matching these positions in tirs from all 21 families is extremely small  
tblastn searches against the trace archive were performed by using the blast client  blastcl3 or netblast at ftp   ftp ncbi nlm nih gov blast executables latest   which accesses the ncbi blast search engine  
names of all available trace databases were taken from a list of databases at http   www ncbi nlm nih gov blast mmtrace shtml

a role for adenosine deaminase in drosophila larval development 
abstract 
adenosine deaminase  ada  is an enzyme present in all organisms that catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine  
both adenosine and deoxyadenosine are biologically active purines that can have a deep impact on cellular physiology  notably  ada deficiency in humans causes severe combined immunodeficiency  
we have established a drosophila model to study the effects of altered adenosine levels in vivo by genetic elimination of adenosine deaminase related growth factor a  adgf a   which has ada activity and is expressed in the gut and hematopoietic organ  
here we show that the hemocytes  blood cells  are the main regulator of adenosine in the drosophila larva  as was speculated previously for mammals  
the block of pupariation appears to involve signaling through the adenosine receptor  ador   but fat body disintegration  which is promoted by action of the hemocytes  seems to be independent of the ador  
the existence of such an independent mechanism has also been suggested in mammals  
introduction 
adenosine deaminase  ada  is an enzyme present in all organisms that catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine  
it is a critically important enzyme for human survival because its congenital absence causes severe combined immunodeficiency disease  scid   
ada deficiency accounts for about 20  of all types of scid  1   
it is one of the most severe human immunodeficiencies and is associated with depletion of all three major categories of lymphocytes  t cells  b cells  and natural killer cells  resulting in impaired cellular immunity and decreased production of immunoglobulins  2   
ada occurs as a soluble monomer in all human cells  but also exists as    ecto ada     bound to the membrane glycoprotein cd26 dipeptidyl peptidase iv  and it has been suggested that this form of ada regulates extracellular adenosine levels  3   
ada deficiency is accompanied by greatly elevated levels of the ada substrates adenosine and deoxyadenosine  both of which are biologically active purines that can have a deep impact on cellular physiology  
adenosine is not just a metabolite  it is also a signaling molecule that regulates numerous cellular functions by binding to g protein coupled adenosine receptors  a1  a2a  a2b  and a3 in mammals  that can regulate intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate  4   
deoxyadenosine is a cytotoxic metabolite released by various cell populations that undergo programmed cell death  it can kill cells through a mechanism that includes disturbances in deoxynucleotide metabolism  5   
extracellular adenosine is now considered an important stress hormone that is released in excessive amounts in the vicinity of immune cells during both systemic and cellular stress  6   
the predominant source of extracellular adenosine during systemic activation of the stress system is the sympathetic nervous system  7   
specific inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial products are also capable of triggering adenosine release from immune cells  8   
these data are in line with evidence demonstrating a dramatic increase in extracellular adenosine levels under conditions associated with multiple organ failure  which is the cause of 50    80  of all deaths in surgical intensive care units  6   
recently  the cat eye syndrome critical region protein 1  cecr1  gene was identified and shown to encode a protein representing a subfamily of proteins related to but distinct from classical adas  9   
the duplication of a small region of chromosome 22 containing this gene is associated with    cat eye syndrome     a disorder characterized by hypoplastic kidneys  congenital heart malformation  and anomalous pulmonary venous connections  
the founding member of this subfamily is encoded by insect derived growth factor idgf   10   and homologs have been described in various organisms  11   14   
we have previously found six drosophila genes with sequence similarity to the cecr1 subfamily  15   
their products are mitogenic on drosophila cells  and at least two of them  adgf a and adgf d  exhibit strong ada activity  which is necessary for their mitogenic function  
we therefore named them adenosine deaminase related growth factors  adgfs   
we also demonstrated that adenosine functions as a negative signal for cell proliferation and concluded that adgfs stimulate cell growth in vitro by depletion of extracellular adenosine  16   
in this report we show that a null mutation in drosophila adgf a gene leads to dramatically increased levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine in the larval hemolymph  
this increase leads to larval death associated with the disintegration of fat body and the development of melanotic tumors  
we present a detailed analysis of the hematopoietic defects associated with the adgf a mutation  show a genetic interaction of this mutation with signaling through the drosophila adenosine receptor  ador  encoded by the gene cg9753  and with regulation of premetamorphic changes by ecdysone  as well as a genetic interaction of adgf a with a major innate immunity regulator   the toll signaling pathway  
results 
mutation in the adgf a gene causes larval death and melanotic tumors 
we produced mutations in five of the six adgf genes by homologous recombination mutagenesis  17  and showed that loss of the most abundantly expressed gene  adgf a  leads to death in the larval or pupal stage  
under optimal conditions  20   30 isolated homozygous larvae per vial   about 60  of larvae homozygous for the adgf a mutation reach the third instar  
development during the third larval instar is significantly delayed  and wandering homozygous larvae usually appear 2 d after their heterozygous siblings  which start wandering at about 5 d of development  
some homozygous third instar larvae can be found alive in the vial even after 10 d of development  
mutant third instar larvae show fat body disintegration  figure 1a and 1b  and multiple melanotic tumors  figure 1c   predominantly in the caudal part of the body and accompanied by disintegration of the fat body  
less than 30  of homozygotes eventually pupate  
there is also an abnormal curvature  to the right  of the pupal abdomen  figure 1d   
to confirm that the mutant phenotype is caused solely by a mutation in the adgf a gene  we created transgenic flies carrying the adgf a gene under a heat shock promoter  hs adgf a   
however  while non heat shocked animals still produced many melanotic tumors  only 22  of animals that were heat shocked as late embryos early first instar developed these tumors  figure 2b   
this result confirms that the mutant phenotype is caused by the mutation in the adgf a gene  
this conclusion is further supported by the even more efficient rescue achieved by expression of transgenically provided adgf a in the lymph glands using the gal4 uas system  see below

each experiment was repeated at least four times  with 20   30 animals in each vial  and the standard error is shown  
 b  percentage of late third instar larvae with melanotic tumors  
the x axis is shared with  a   described above   
the y axis shows the percentage of larvae with tumors out of all larvae of each genotype examined for  a   
the adgf a mutant phenotype is associated with elevated levels of adenosine and or deoxyadenosine 
using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry of deproteinated hemolymph samples  we measured adenosine concentrations in hemolymph of mutant and wild type third instar larvae  
the adenosine concentration in the adgf a mutant was 1 14    0 26  m compared to less than 0 08  m in the wild type  and the deoxyadenosine concentration in mutants was 1 66    0 99  m compared to an undetectable level in the wild type  
the catalytic activity of adgf a is required for its function 
to test whether the function of adgf a in vivo is also dependent on its catalytic activity  we produced two versions of the uas adgf a construct  18   one carrying wild type cdna of adgf a and one carrying an adgf a cdna with a mutation causing a substitution of two amino acids  h386g and a387e  in the catalytic domain  16   
this result therefore demonstrates that the catalytic activity of adgf a is required for its function in vivo  
hemocyte development is affected in the adgf a mutant 
we investigated the number and morphology of hemocytes  blood cells  in the hemolymph of the adgf a late third instar larvae  figures 3 and 4   
these larvae contain an average of seven fold more hemocytes in circulation than wild type larvae  figure 3   
in contrast to normal larval plasmatocytes  which remain rounded after settling down on the substrate  figure 4a   most of the cells in the adgf a mutant  more than 75   are strongly adhesive and  after they are deposited in a drop of hemolymph on a microscope slide  develop filamentous and membranous extensions  figure 4b   4d   
crystal cells were also detected in excess  with mutant larvae carrying several hundred while there are fewer than a hundred of these cells in the wild type  figure 5   
however  the lymph glands of adgf a mutant larvae are already dispersed in the late third instar  
this process is similar to normal metamorphic changes  in which the hemocytes are first released from the front lobes  and the posterior lobes disperse later  
to analyze hemocytes in living larvae  we used the hemolectin marker  hml   21   
we compared the number and distribution of hemocytes stained by gfp in flies carrying hml gal4 uas gfp in wild type and mutant backgrounds  
while there are relatively few hemocytes  mostly free floating in the hemolymph  in early third instar wild type larvae  see figure 4i   a much higher number of hemocytes  which are mostly attached to the tissues under the integument  described as sessile hemocytes in  19    was observed in mutant larvae  see figure 4j   
a similar behavior was detected later in wild type larvae  toward the end of the third instar  see figure 4h   
at this stage  the hml marker disappeared from the most of the hemocytes in mutants  see figure 4f and 4g   
number of circulating hemocytes in late third instar larvae 
genotypes are shown along the x axis  and the number of hemocytes larva along the y axis  
each bar shows the number of all circulating hemocytes  and the gray part of the bars represent the lamellocyte population

the adgf a mutant phenotype is rescued by expression of adgf a in the lymph glands 
to distinguish which tissues require adgf a expression for proper development  we tested for rescue of adgf a lethality by expressing adgf a in specific subsets of larval tissues  
a transgenic line carrying the uas adgf a construct on chromosome ii was crossed to lines expressing the gal4 driver  18  in different tissues  table 1   
since adgf a is normally expressed in the larval lymph glands  16   and the mutant phenotype is characterized by abnormal hemocyte development  special consideration was given to lines expressing the gal4 driver in the lymph glands and or circulating hemocytes  
in e33c gal4 uas adgf a  strong expression of adgf a in all lobes of developing lymph glands  but not in circulating hemocytes  reduces the number of hemocytes in the hemolymph to almost normal levels  see figure 3   
the number of hemocytes is also reduced  but to a lesser extent in larvae rescued by cg gal4 uas adgf a  
however  when assayed by survival rate and melanotic tumor formation  the rescue by cg gal4 is full and similar to that of e33c gal4  see figure 2   
the difference in effectiveness may be explained by the different expression patterns of the drivers  
cg gal4 is expressed only in certain compartments of lymph gland lobes containing relatively mature hemocytes  and strongly in most circulating hemocytes  22  23   
we have tried two different insertions of the dot gal4 construct  
since adgf a is strongly expressed in embryonic mesoderm  16   we have tried to rescue the phenotype by the expression of adgf a in embryonic and larval muscle cells using the dmef2 gal4 driver  25   
ablation of hemocytes in mutant larvae reduces fat body disintegration and melanotic tumor formation 
the l 3 hematopoiesis missing l 3 hem  mutation reduces cell division in larval proliferating tissues and thus dramatically reduces the number of hemocytes in larvae  
it also suppresses the hemocyte overproliferation and associated defects observed in the hopscotchtumorous lethal mutant  26   
we therefore used the l 3 hem1 mutation to test whether the reduction of hemocyte number in the adgf a mutant affects the phenotype  
we recombined this mutation onto the chromosome containing the adgf a mutation and found that in homozygous l 3 hem1 adgf a double mutants the number of hemocytes is significantly reduced compared to the adgf a single mutants  see figure 3   
furthermore  while 90  of adgf a mutant larvae showed disintegration of fat body  only 40  of l 3 hem1 adgf a double mutants  total number of counted animals was 82  show the disintegration  figure 6a   
similarly  melanotic tumor formation is significantly suppressed by l 3 hem1  with only 55  of double mutants showing melanotic tumors compared to more than 83  in adgf a  figure 6a   
this shows that the effect on hemocyte development is related to only one other aspect of the adgf a phenotype   namely  fat body disintegration   and the developmental arrest of adgf a mutants is probably independent of this process

block in activation of macrophages suppresses disintegration of fat body 
previous results suggest that fat body disintegration might be caused by the action of hemocytes  
embryonic macrophages express the scavenger receptor encoded by croquemort crq   which allows them to bind and remove apoptotic corpses  27   
we therefore tested whether a mutation in the crq gene would block the suggested interaction between hemocytes and fat body in adgf a mutant larvae  
we used the mutation crqkg01679  caused by a p element insertion in the first untranslated exon of crq  which leads to pupal lethality  
the double mutants showed a lower number of circulating hemocytes than the single mutant  but there was still a significant increase in this number compared to wild type  see figure 3   and the cells showed increased clumping  
this shows that the block of the putative interaction between fat body and macrophage like cells  which are still present in double mutants  suppresses the fat body disintegration  further strengthening the hypothesis that the disintegration is caused by hemocytes  
mutation in a putative adenosine receptor suppresses the block of pupariation in adgf a 
we have identified a putative homolog of the mammalian adenosine receptor family in the drosophila genome  ador  and produced a null mutation in this gene using homologous recombination  ador  ed  unpublished data   
the ador mutants are fully viable  
we used this mutant to test the hypothesis that the increased level of adenosine in the adgf a mutant contributes to the mutant phenotype by its effect on signaling through the adenosine receptor  
the results show that introducing the ador mutation into the adgf a background significantly increases pupariation  as well as adult emerging rate  compared to the adgf a single mutant  figure 6b   
when the earlier lethality was avoided by picking up larvae after molt to the third instar  the pupariation rate of ador  adgf a double mutant was comparable to wild type as well as to the single adgf a mutant treated with ecdysone  figure 7a   
development during the third instar is much less delayed in the double mutant  with most of the larvae pupariating within 1 d after their heterozygous siblings  figure 7a   
the ador mutation also significantly reduced melanotic tumor formation in the adgf a mutant  see figure 6a   but disintegration of the fat body appeared at the same rate as in the single mutant  see figure 6a   
while the number of macrophage like cells in circulation is not significantly changed in the double mutant  the number of lamellocytes is decreased  see figure 3   but the number of crystal cells is normal  see figure 5a and 5c

hormonal regulation in the adgf a mutant 
the delayed development and low pupariation rate in the adgf a mutant larvae  see figures 2a and 7a  could be caused by an effect on hormonal regulation of development  
the main source of developmental hormones in the drosophila larva is the ring gland  composed of the prothoracic gland  corpus allatum  and corpus cardiacum  28   
the prothoracic gland releases the steroid molting hormone ecdysone  which is converted to an active form  20 hydroxyecdysone  20e   by the fat body as well as some of the target organs  29   
to test this possibility  we tried to rescue the phenotype by feeding mutant larvae 20e  which can initiate pupariation in the ecd1 mutant  which has an extremely low level of ecdysone  30 31   
the results  figure 7a  clearly demonstrate that the adgf a mutant larvae are responsive to ecdysone and that this treatment restores the pupariation frequency to almost wild type level  
the delay in development is also significantly reduced  figure 7a   
since the adgf a mutant shows certain precocious metamorphic changes  macrophage differentiation and fat body disintegration   we speculated that a reduced ecdysteroid level could be caused by precocious degeneration of the prothoracic part of the ring gland  
we also used a transgenic line carrying the sgs 3 gfp construct  which was previously used to monitor the effects of ecdysteroid levels on glue protein expression in salivary glands  32   
all analyzed adgf a mutant larvae carrying the sgs 3 gfp construct showed normal expression of sgs gfp in salivary glands  figure 7d   
mutants that pupariated usually showed typical gfp expectoration  indicating the presence of a high premetamorphic peak of ecdysteroids  figure 7e   
these results demonstrate that the target tissues of adgf a mutants are normally responsive to ecdysteroids and that they are probably capable of releasing ecdysteroids  although the level of ecdysteroids might vary    
adgf a genetically interacts with toll signaling pathway 
the antimicrobial response of drosophila includes at least two distinct signaling pathways  34    the toll signaling pathway  which leads to the activation of two nuclear factor kappa b  nf  b  factors  dorsal related immunity factor  dif  and dorsal  dl   and the immune deficiency protein pathway activating the third nf  b factor  relish  rel   
a zygotic null mutation in cactus  cact  a drosophila inhibitor of nf  b  leads to hyperproliferation of hemocytes  melanotic tumor formation  disintegration of fat body  and slower larval development  with 60  larval lethality  as well as a thin body shape phenotype  35   
all of these phenotypes are strikingly similar to the abnormalities seen in adgf a mutants  which was our first clue as to a possible interaction of adgf a with the toll signaling pathway  
we hypothesized that the activity of adgf a is suppressed by toll signaling  resulting in similar phenotypes of the adgf a mutation and constitutive activation of toll pathway  
to test this hypothesis  we crossed transgenic flies carrying adgf a gene under the control of a heat shock promoter on chromosome ii  hs adgf a  with cacte8  a lethal allele of cact on chromosome ii  which  in combination with cactd13  results in a zygotic null combination  or  with cactiiig  results in zygotic hypomorphic combination   
overexpression of adgf a in animals with a hypomorphic cact combination  cacte8 cactiiig  increased the adult survival rate almost 4 fold  figure 8a   
the rescue could be increased by multiple heat shocks before pupariation to 7 fold  unpublished data   
the suppression of melanotic tumor formation is also significant  from more than 80  down to 26   figure 8b   
the most severe cact null mutation  cacte8 cactd13   leading to developmental arrest in larvae  less than 8  pupate   is partially rescued in animals with overexpression of adgf a when the pupariation rate is increased 3 fold  figure 8a   
these results demonstrate that adgf a overexpression can partially rescue the effects of constitutively active toll signaling in larvae  mainly the developmental arrest  but also the melanotic tumor formation  in the case of hypomorphic cact mutants

discussion 
ada deficiency in drosophila causes abnormal hemocyte development  melanotic tumor formation  fat body degeneration  and delayed development 
we have established an ada deficiency model in drosophila in order to study the effects of altered adenosine levels in vivo  
we produced a loss of function mutation in the adgf a gene  which produces a product  adgf a  with ada activity  
when homozygous  the mutation causes abnormal hemocyte development  leading to melanotic tumor formation  36   as well as fat body disintegration associated with death during the larval stage or delayed transition to the pupal stage of development  
in agreement with our previous study using cells cultured in vitro  16   here we have shown that ada enzymatic activity is essential for adgf a function in vivo  when this function is assayed by testing for rescue of the mutant phenotype  
just as increased levels of both ada substrates  adenosine and deoxyadenosine  are found in blood of scid patients  5   adgf a mutant larvae also have elevated levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine  indicating that the mutant phenotype is caused by disturbance in the turnover of these nucleosides  
expression of adgf a only in the lymph glands is sufficient to fully rescue the mutant phenotype  indicating that the hemocytes within the lymph glands play a major role in regulation of adenosine levels in the hemolymph  
a similar regulatory role has also been attributed to blood cells in humans  5   
this suggests a function for adgf a within the lymph gland  
however  adgf a behaves as a soluble growth factor and could be released from the lymph gland to activate targets elsewhere in the larval body  
our results show that adgf a functions by limiting the level of extracellular adenosine  and in this way the protein could have a systemic function even if it were restricted to its tissue of origin  
adgf a is involved in hemocyte differentiation in the lymph glands 
late third instar larvae homozygous for the adgf a mutation contain  on average  seven times more hemocytes in circulation than wild type larvae  and most of these cells show strong adhesive properties compared to normal larval plasmatocytes  which remain rounded after settling down on the substrate  
in agreement with the presence of these cells in circulation  at least the first lobes of the lymph glands are usually completely dispersed in late third instar mutant larvae  
recent studies show that the toll signaling pathway  which is already known to be involved in the control of innate immunity of both drosophila and mammals  34   may also be involved in the control of hemocyte differentiation in the drosophila larva  
constitutive activation of toll signaling leads to developmental arrest and hematopoietic defects associated with melanotic tumor formation  35   similar to the phenotype of the adgf a mutant  
our work also shows that forced expression of the adgf a gene can rescue the effects of overactive toll signaling  suggesting that adgf a might function downstream of toll signaling to control its effects  
this conclusion is consistent with the existence of a putative binding site for dorsal  one of two known effectors of toll signaling  in the adgf a promoter  figure 9   
it will be important to explore this connection further  since recent studies suggest an interaction between adenosine signaling and the nf  b signaling pathway  which is the mammalian counterpart of the toll pathway  37   
schematic map of the adgf a gene with promoter analysis 
the adgf a gene contains four exons and two transcriptional starts  17 47   
we analyzed sequences preceding both transcriptional starts for the presence of known transcriptional factor binding sites using the software program gene2promoter  genomatix software gmbh   
selected sites are represented by color bars in approximate positions of promoter regions  
the legend under the sequence show the names of transcription factors binding to matching colored binding sites  
precocious fat body disintegration caused by mutant hemocytes 
one of the most remarkable features of the adgf a mutant phenotype is the disintegration of the fat body in third instar larvae  another indication of precocious metamorphic changes since the disintegration normally occurs much later  during pupal life  
furthermore  our study of this mutant provides strong evidence that the fat body disintegration is promoted by the action of hemocytes  
fat body disintegration was significantly suppressed when the hemocyte number was reduced using the l 3 hem1 mutation  26   and fully blocked by the croquemort  crq  mutation  27  which affects a cd36 related receptor  croquemort  expressed on macrophages and required in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells  
human cd36 is a scavenger receptor which  in combination with the macrophage vitronectin receptor and thrombospondin  binds apoptotic cells  
the idea that hemocytes are involved in fat body dissociation in drosophila is further supported by work on the flesh fly sarcophaga  
natori s group showed that proteinase cathepsin b was released from pupal hemocytes when they interacted with the fat body  and that this enzyme digested the basement membrane of the fat body  causing the tissue to dissociate  38 39   
they also showed that the interaction of hemocytes with the fat body is mediated by a 120 kda membrane protein localized specifically on pupal hemocytes  40   
work by franc et al   27  is consistent with the idea that more than one scavenger receptor is involved in this process  
possible signaling role for adenosine 
the precocious metamorphic changes that appear to occur in response to elevated adenosine in the adgf a mutant larvae lead to the suggestion that adenosine may act as a regulatory signal for these processes during normal development  
one possibility is that adenosine acts as a downstream effector of ecdysone regulated prepupal changes  and that the increase in adenosine concentration is mediated by ecdysone induced down regulation of adgf a expression  
this is supported by the presence of multiple sites for ecdysone inducible transcription regulators in the adgf a promoter  figure 9   
we are now carrying out direct tests of the idea that the differentiation of hemocytes in mutant larvae is caused by elevated adenosine  
if confirmed  this effect would have general significance  since in ada deficient mice  inflammatory changes in the lungs include an accumulation of activated alveolar macrophages  41   and this could also be mediated by elevated adenosine  
elevated adenosine delays development and inhibits pupariation 
the elevated adenosine in the adgf a mutant larvae leads to precocious changes  hemocyte differentiation and fat body disintegration  resembling those normally occurring at the time of metamorphosis  but it also is associated with an apparently opposite effect  in that it causes a significant delay in progress through the third larval instar and a decrease in the frequency of successful pupariation  formation of the puparium from the larval cuticle   which is one of the earliest steps in metamorphosis  
we conclude that the mutation has additional effects on the hormonal regulation of development  
this is supported by the fact that pupariation rate and survival of the adgf a mutant can be significantly improved by expression of transgenic adgf a in the ring gland and salivary glands  
we suggest that this somehow interferes with the regulation of hormone release  
presumably the elevated adenosine in the adgf a mutant blocks the production or release of ecdysone from the ring gland by an unknown mechanism  
this idea is supported by our finding that both pupariation rate and survival of the adgf a mutant can also be improved by feeding the mutant larvae with 20e in the diet  see figure 7a   
thus it is clear that the adgf a mutant is arrested in development due to an effect of the mutation on hormone production from the ring gland  
the arrest of development in the adgf a mutants was significantly suppressed by loss of the adenosine receptor caused by the ador mutation  larvae simply homozygous for adgf a pupated after two or more days  whereas larvae also homozygous for ador pupated within 1 d after their heterozygous siblings  see figure 7a   
therefore  adenosine signaling through the ador must play a role in the developmental arrest of the adgf a mutant  and this is most likely mediated by signaling to the ring gland  where ador is expressed  ed  unpublished data   
work using adenosine receptor deficient mammalian cells also suggested the existence of a novel  undefined adenosine signaling mechanism  44   
however  we cannot exclude the role of elevated deoxyadenosine in these effects  
drosophila  now with the advantage of the well characterized adgf a mutant  could serve as an ideal model system in which to investigate this mechanism  
concluding remarks 
in our previous work using cells cultured in vitro  we showed that  as in mammals  adenosine can block proliferation and or survival of some drosophila cell types  16   
in the present work  we have established a drosophila model to study altered levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine in vivo  and we have shown that loss of adgf a function causes an increase of these nucleosides in larval hemolymph  
rather  this mutation leads to an increase in number of hemocytes at the end of larval development due to the differentiation and release of hemocytes from the lymph glands  
hemocytes also differentiate and are released from the lymph glands during systemic infection  19   
together with our result suggesting an interaction between toll signaling and adgf a  this leads to the hypothesis that adenosine controls hemocyte differentiation in response to infection  and that it signals through the adenosine receptor to postpone the next developmental step  metamorphosis  
this would be consistent with the role of adenosine as a    stress hormone    in mammals  6   
a similar process of hemocyte differentiation and release from the lymph glands normally takes place at the onset of metamorphosis  when pupal macrophages remove histolyzing tissues  
the adgf a promoter contains consensus binding sites for effectors of both toll and ecdysone signaling  
this raises the possibility that adenosine plays a role in the control of metamorphosis as well as in the response to stress

a comparison of programmed cell death between species 
abstract 
key components of the programmed cell death pathway are conserved between caenorhabditis elegans  drosophila melanogaster and humans  
the search for additional homologs has been facilitated by the availability of the entire genomic sequence for each of these organisms  
programmed cell death is a conserved  gene directed mechanism for the elimination of unnecessary or dangerous cells from an organism  
the core cell death pathway was first defined through genetic analysis in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans and has since been found to be conserved in species as diverse as drosophila melanogaster and homo sapiens  
the rapid progress of the various genome sequencing projects has greatly accelerated the discovery of homologs for key components of the cell death pathway as well as for its regulators  
the c  elegans genome sequence was completed two years ago  1   and both the drosophila  2  and human genomes are essentially completely sequenced at this point  
although many components of the programmed cell death pathway are conserved between species  there are some important differences as well  
the core cell death pathway 
programmed cell death has long been known to be a part of normal development  but it was not until the discovery of the first genes essential for the phenomenon that our understanding of the events leading up to the deliberate elimination of a cell began to take shape  
before this time  programmed cell death was defined by a set of specific morphological characteristics  including chromatin condensation  nuclear shrinkage and blebbing of the plasma membrane that could be observed in dying cells  the term apoptosis was coined to distinguish this type of cell death from necrotic deaths resulting from injury  3 4   
four genes make up the core programmed cell death pathway in c  elegans  three of which  egl 1  egg laying abnormal   ced 3  cell death abnormal   and ced 4  are pro apoptotic and one  ced 9  is anti apoptotic  reviewed in  5    
there was considerable excitement in the field when potential mammalian and drosophila homologs for ced 3  ced 4  ced 9  and egl 1 were discovered  
the ced 3 protein is one of a continuously growing family of specific cysteine proteases  termed caspases  that are thought to be the executioners of programmed cell death  
at least fourteen mammalian caspases have been identified  and they are grouped into two classes on the basis of their proteolytic specificities  reviewed in  6    
class 1 caspases are mainly involved in cytokine maturation  while class 2 caspases act mainly in apoptosis  
class 2 has been further subdivided into two groups  upstream or initiator caspases  group 1   and downstream or effector caspases  group 2   
initiator caspases are thought to be at the beginning of a proteolytic cascade that amplifies the cell death signal and results in the activation of the effector caspases  
initiator caspases usually have long pro domains  while effector caspases have short pro domains  
drosophila has at least eight caspases  five of which have been at least partially characterized  dcp 1  dcp 2 dredd  drice  dronc  and decay  and three uncharacterized ones found encoded in the genome sequence  7   
c  elegans appears to have only a single caspase   ced 3   that is essential for all developmental cell death  despite having three other caspases in its genome  8 9   
three drosophila caspases   dcp 2 dredd  dronc  and one known only as a sequence in the genome database   have long pro domains and are thus likely initiator caspases  another four   dcp 1  drice  decay  and another one found in the genome database   have short pro domains and are probably effector caspases  
in addition  dcp 1 has a substrate specificity that is very similar to that of two effector caspases  mammalian caspase 3 and c  elegans ced 3  10   
interestingly  dronc appears to have a substrate specificity that is so far unique among caspases  while all other known caspases have only been shown to cleave after aspartate residues  dronc can also cleave after glutamate residues  11   
this unusual substrate specificity may explain why dronc is resistant to inhibition by the pan caspase inhibitor p35  
on the basis of current data  it seems that ced 4 functions to help activate the caspase ced 3  and ced 9 blocks this activation through physical interaction with ced 4  
endogenous ced 4 is normally localized to the mitochondria by ced 9  unless egl 1 is expressed  12 13   
if egl 1 is expressed  the interaction between ced 4 and ced 9 ceases  and ced 4 translocates to the nuclear membrane where it activates ced 3  resulting in programmed cell death  
only one mammalian ced 4 homolog  apaf 1  has been extensively characterized to date  but it too aids in caspase activation  
like ced 4  apaf 1 requires datp for caspase activation  but apaf 1 requires cytochrome c in addition  14   
knock out studies have shown that mice deficient for apaf 1 have reduced cell death in certain tissues  further supporting a role for apaf 1 in programmed cell death  
drosophila has recently been shown also to have a ced 4 apaf 1 homolog  named dark hac 1 dapaf 1  reviewed in  15    
the drosophila homolog is more similar to apaf 1 than to ced 4  it has the wd repeats found in apaf 1  which potentially function in binding regulatory proteins such as cytochrome c  
like apaf 1 and ced 4  loss of function mutations in dark hac 1 dapaf 1 result in a reduction in developmental programmed cell death  
intriguingly  the transcription of the drosophila ced 4 apaf 1 homolog is upregulated in response to both x ray and ultraviolet irradiation  suggesting that death inducing stimuli can feed into the cell death pathway at this step  16   
ced 9 and egl 1 belong to a large family of proteins related to the mammalian anti apoptotic protein bcl 2  
this family   with at least 19 members  divided into pro  and anti apoptotic subgroups   has been largely defined by protein protein interactions among its members  reviewed in  17    
ced 9 has mammalian counterparts in the anti apoptotic subgroup of bcl 2 family members  while egl 1 has mammalian counterparts in the pro apoptotic subgroup  
besides binding to apaf 1  just as ced 9 binds and thereby regulates ced 4 activity  mammalian bcl 2 family members have been proposed to regulate mitochondrial homeostasis and the release of pro apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c  reviewed in  17    
the rate of mitochondrial release of cytochrome c in mammalian cells undergoing apoptosis was recently measured and found to be rapid  18   
there is no clear evidence for cytochrome c release during apoptosis in c  elegans or drosophila  however  
nevertheless  a specific epitope is uncovered on cytochrome c in drosophila mitochondria during apoptosis and this may be sufficient to help activate dark hac 1 dapaf 1  and death inducing stimuli result in an increase in cytochrome c in drosophila cultured cell lysates  19 20   
recently  a pro apoptotic drosophila bcl 2 family member was identified with the help of the database of genomic sequence  this gene is most closely related to mammalian bok and potentially regulates apoptosis in the fly  21 22 23 24   
ectopic expression of bok protein promotes apoptosis in transgenic flies as well as in cultured cells  
this difference may be due to the slightly different constructs used in the experiments and the different assay systems  
a third group shows that peptide caspase inhibitors can block drosophila bok mediated apoptosis in cell culture  lending support to a model in which expression of bok protein leads to caspase activation  24   
interestingly  ectopic expression of drosophila bok sensitizes the developing eye to cell death induced by ultraviolet irradiation  21   
genetically  this drosophila bcl 2 family member appears to function upstream of  or in parallel to  the drosophila ced 4 apaf 1 homolog and downstream of  or in parallel to  the drosophila regulators of apoptosis  reaper  hid  and grim  22   
the core components of the cell death pathway are illustrated in figure 1  
the core pathway of programmed cell death  
multiple pathways lead to the activation of the executioners of death  the caspases  reviewed in  53    
iaps  inhibitors of apoptosis  have been shown to block the conversion of pro caspases into active enzymes  and reaper  hid  grim  and diablo smac prevent iaps from carrying out this protective function  
caspases can also be activated with the aid of apaf 1  which in turn appears to be regulated by cytochrome c and datp  
the bcl 2 family appears to function in regulating the release of pro apoptotic components from mitochondria as well as by possibly inhibiting apaf 1 directly  
this pathway integrates knowledge gained in multiple species  showing that apoptosis appears to be regulated in a similar manner regardless of the organism  
regulation of programmed cell death 
studies of drosophila have yielded great insights into how programmed cell death is regulated  reviewed in  25    
in addition to the core pathway  several essential regulators have been characterized in drosophila  
a region in the genome which contains the genes reaper  head involution defective  hid   and grim has been shown to be essential for virtually all developmental cell death in the drosophila embryo  
each of these three genes can induce programmed cell death when overexpressed in the developing drosophila eye or in various tissue culture assays  
in addition  reaper  hid and grim are able to induce apoptosis in heterologous systems  suggesting that vertebrate homologs of these proteins exist  reviewed in  26    
further evidence for the existence of vertebrate homologs of reaper  hid  and grim come from observations that these three proteins are able to bind a class of inhibitors of apoptosis  or iaps  
iaps were first discovered in baculovirus  but have since been shown to play a vital role in blocking apoptosis in drosophila as well as in mammals  reviewed in  27    
also  hid has been shown to be negatively regulated by survival signals mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases through the ras and mitogen activated protein  map  kinase pathway  which is also well conserved in mammals  28 29   
more recently  reports of a potential functional mammalian analog of reaper  hid  and grim have been published  30 31   
furthermore  diablo smac interacts through its amino terminus with the bir  baculovirus iap repeat  domains of iaps  similar to reaper  hid  and grim  32 33   
table 1 provides a summary of the conserved regulators of cell death across species  
in contrast to cell death effectors such as caspases  the cell death regulators reaper and grim are specifically expressed several hours before apoptosis in cells destined to die  reviewed in  26    
the expression of reaper has been shown to be regulated by distinct stimuli  including x irradiation  steroid hormone signaling and a block in cell differentiation   34 35 36  and a  f  lambin and h s   unpublished observations   
recently  a drosophila p53 ortholog was identified by searching the genome database  reviewed in  37    and it was shown to bind a specific region of the reaper promoter  thereby potentially regulating reaper transcription in response to ionizing radiation  
furthermore  the reaper promoter was also shown to contain a response element for the complex made up of the steroid hormone ecdysone and its receptor  36   
the observation that transcription of both reaper and dark hac 1 dapaf 1 can be induced by ionizing radiation suggests that these death inducing signals can feed into the cell death pathway at multiple points  
unlike reaper and grim  hid appears to be regulated not only transcriptionally but also post translationally by the ras map kinase pathway  28 29   
this additional level of control for hid could explain the observation that hid is expressed in cells that are doomed to die as well as in cells that continue to survive  38   
a second class of key apoptotic regulators in drosophila is the iap family  
iaps contain at least one  and up to three  bir domains  which are important for protein protein interactions  and often a carboxy terminal ring domain  reviewed in  27    
while several iaps have been implicated in inhibiting apoptosis  proteins with single bir domains can also have functions in cell cycle regulation and cytokinesis  39 40   
three drosophila birps have been shown to be inhibitors of apoptosis  diap1  diap2  and deterin  42 43 44 45   
of these  diap1 has been most extensively characterized  it can block cell death caused by the ectopic expression of reaper  hid  and grim  reviewed in  26    
in addition  diap1 is able to block the cell death induced by the drosophila caspases dcp 1 or drice in saccharomyces  as well as apoptosis induced by the expression of drice in insect cell culture  46 47 48   
loss of function mutants in diap1 have a very striking early embryonic phenotype  virtually all cells display an apoptotic morphology  as well as displaying dna fragmentation seen by tunel labeling  four to five hours into development  47 49 50   
this phenotype is especially noteworthy since it manifests itself several hours before the first developmental cell deaths are normally observed in the drosophila embryo  and it clearly shows that diap1 is vital for normal development  
in general  iaps are thought to function at the caspase activation step in the cell death pathway  binding to the inactive  pro domain containing caspase zymogen and preventing it from being processed into the active enzyme  reviewed in  27    
reaper  hid  grim  and diablo smac can physically interact with iaps  thereby inhibiting the anti apoptotic activity of iaps and allowing caspase activation  
further insight into a possible mechanism for iap function was recently gained when iaps were observed to have ubiquitin ligase activity  51 52   
it was shown that certain cellular iaps can be degraded in a proteasome dependent manner prior to thymocyte apoptosis  
these iaps are also capable of auto ubiquitination  an activity shown to require the ring domain  52   
in addition  iaps can mono ubiquitinate several caspases in vitro  possibly marking them for degradation  and again  this activity requires the ring domain  51   
the exact role of the ubiquitination pathway in regulating apoptosis is still unclear  
even the role of the ring domain in iaps is open to debate  mutations in the ring domain of endogenous diap1 can be either pro  or anti apoptotic  depending on the death inducing stimulus   49  and j  agapite  l  goyal  k  mccall and h s   unpublished observations   
conservation of key regulators of programmed cell death between species 
strengths and limitations of genomic analysis 
the completed genomes of c  elegans and drosophila have already yielded a wealth of information  
new cell death gene homologs are being described at a very rapid pace  often by several laboratories at once  
hence  c  elegans seems to have a mechanism for regulating caspase activation that differs from that of mammals and drosophila  in that it relies solely on the two bcl 2 family members  53   
for drosophila  the genome project played a key role in the identification of the bcl 2 family member s  and the ced 4 apaf 1 homolog  showing that the core cell death pathway is conserved in drosophila as well  
various other homologs for cell death genes  including three additional caspase like sequences and a second bcl 2 family member have been identified in the drosophila genome sequence  7  and will undoubtedly be published in the near future  
and analysis of the human genomic sequence is sure to lead to a better understanding of the number of mammalian homologs for the various components of the cell death pathway  
while it is clear that the search for homologs of known cell death genes has been greatly facilitated by the availability of the entire genome sequence for c  elegans  drosophila  and humans  there are limitations to this strategy  
for instance  the small size of the reaper protein   only of 65 amino acids   makes it extremely difficult to identify homologs on the basis of genomic sequence information in other species  current gene finding programs typically require an open reading frame of at least 70 amino acids  
furthermore  there is considerable divergence even among cell death proteins with clearly homologous functions  such as ced 4 apaf 1 and even ced 9 bcl 2  and sequence homology between these genes was recognized only after the genes and their products had been functionally characterized  
nevertheless  in combination with traditional approaches including genetics and biochemistry  knowledge of the genome sequence for model organisms will undoubtedly continue to drive our rapidly increasing insights into the molecular basis of programmed cell death  
multiple rna protein interactions in drosophila dosage compensation 
abstract 
from worms to humans  recognizing and modifying a specific chromosome is essential for dosage compensation  the mechanism by which equal x linked gene expression in males and females is achieved  
recent molecular genetic and biochemical studies have provided new insights into how regulatory factors in drosophila are recruited and assembled on the x chromosome  leading to the essential hypertranscription of its genes  
distinct mechanisms of dosage compensation 
dosage compensation  which ensures that the expression of x linked genes is equal in males and females  is an essential process in organisms that have sex chromosomes  
because sex chromosomes appeared relatively late in evolution  dosage compensation evolved independently in different organisms and is accomplished by distinct mechanisms  
for example  in caenorhabditis elegans  dosage compensation occurs in the homogametic hermaphrodite  xx  by the down regulation of virtually all genes on the two x chromosomes by about 50   
in mammals  dosage compensation also occurs in the homogametic sex  the female  by x inactivation  whereby an entire x chromosome forms a distinct  heterochromatic  transcriptionally inactive nuclear structure known as the barr body  
consequently  each gene on the single active x chromosome in female cells and the corresponding gene on the single x chromosome in male cells are expressed at equal levels  
in drosophila  dosage compensation is achieved in the heterogametic male by a twofold chromosome wide up regulation  hypertranscription  of essentially all genes on the single x chromosome  
in c  elegans and drosophila  several proteins with different molecular functions involved in dosage compensation have been identified  
much attention has been dedicated to the elusive question of how the compensated or inactivated chromosomes are recognized by these proteins  and three recent papers investigating some of these aspects in drosophila have provided new insights into this mystery  1 2 3   
at least one common theme has emerged in drosophila and mammals of how the dosage compensated chromosomes are marked and eventually recognized by regulatory proteins  the use of non coding rnas transcribed from genes located on the x chromosome itself  4 5 6 7   
these rnas  xist  x inactive specific transcript  in mammals  and rox1 and rox2  rna on the x  in drosophila  are structurally unrelated  yet they share the intriguing property of remaining tightly associated with the x chromosome  
in mammals  xist rna is transcribed only from the inactive x  with which it associates at its site of synthesis and then spreads over the entire chromosome through an unknown mechanism  8   
it is assumed that xist rna provides a mark for specific histones  for example  histone macroh2a1 2   as well as proteins deacetylating histones and methylating many of the x linked genes at gpc dinucleotides  9 10 11   all these events are important for maintaining the silenced state of the inactivated x  
the drosophila dosage compensation complex 
in drosophila  the dosage compensation complex  dcc  is composed of five proteins encoded by the male specific lethal genes  male specific lethal 1   2   3  msl1  msl2 and msl3   maleless  mle  and males absent on the first  mof   and at least two non coding rnas  rox1 and rox2  for a review see  12    
hypertranscription is a consequence of at least one chromatin modification  the acetylation of histone h4 at lys16  which is thought to   loosen   chromatin structure  thereby allowing the general transcription machinery easier access to the regulatory regions of most x linked genes  13   
the role of the rox genes and rox rnas in this process is still unclear  
localization studies of msl proteins in male nuclei carrying autosomal rox1 or rox2 transgenes showed that the rox genes or rnas recruit the entire set of msl proteins to their transgenic location and can lead locally to acetylation of histone h4  1 14   
moreover  the dccs can spread  by several hundred kilobases  into neighboring autosomal dna  
these experiments indicated that the rox genes might function as nuclear entry sites for the assembly of the msl proteins on the x chromosome  
little was known  however  about the specific role of the rox rnas during the formation of the dcc  
the three recent papers  1 2 3  have now started to address the role of the rox genes in this process and investigated which msl proteins interact with the rox rnas  
meller et al   1  took advantage of the fact that dosage compensation can be initiated and analyzed in females ectopically expressing the male specific msl2 protein  
these females hypertranscribe their two x chromosomes and therefore die during development  but they can be rescued if any other msl mutation is present  
it has been shown previously  using a similar strategy  that the dcc is assembled in an ordered sequence  figure 1   
for example  msl1 and msl2 are the first proteins to bind to the x chromosome  in the absence of all other msl proteins they associate with about 35 sites  the so called chromatin entry sites  
msl1 and msl2 are interdependent  however  they require each other for binding  15   
mle appears to be the next protein to join the growing dcc as it is found at reduced levels at some of these 35 sites when the remaining two proteins  msl3 and mof  are absent  16   
these latter two proteins require all the other msl proteins to be present to enable them to associate with the x chromosome  
importantly  all msls are required to generate the normal dcc distribution to the hundreds of sites throughout the entire x chromosome  
they found that rox1 and rox2 rnas are associated with the x chromosome at different stages and sites during the assembly of the dcc  
these findings indicate that rox2 might be incorporated into this partial dcc complex in an mle dependent manner and that rox1 rna is incorporated at a later stage  together with msl3 and perhaps mof  
further evidence that at least rox2 rna is an integral part of the dcc comes from independent immunoprecipitation experiments from all three groups  1 2 3  using extracts from drosophila s2 cells that express all the msls and rox2 rna  
the ordered assembly data from meller et al   1  as well as the fact that mle is the only protein in the dcc featuring a known rna binding domain pointed towards the rna helicase mle as the primary candidate for a partner for the rox2 rna  
akthar et al   2  turned their focus towards the mof protein as a potential candidate for interaction with rox2 rna  
mof is the crucial component that links the dcc to the x chromosome specific acetylated form of histone h4  
mof encodes an 827 amino acid protein containing an amino terminus of unknown function  a chromodomain  a zinc finger and a carboxy terminal histone acetyltransferase  hat  domain  
the hat domain of mof is responsible for histone h4 acetylation  both in vivo and in vitro  as shown by smith et al   3   
akthar et al   2  then tested the putative rna binding property of mof directly using electromobility shift assays  
mof appeared to bind to rna rather non specifically  but preferred rna to dna  
in agreement with the immunoprecipitation results  they found that an intact chromodomain is essential for rna binding  whereas the amino terminus or the hat domain of mof was not essential  
furthermore  they also showed that msl3  which features two chromodomains on its own  also shows rox rna binding properties  
although the specificity of these interactions remains to be investigated  the findings of akthar and coworkers  2  provide a new possible role for chromodomains involved in rna binding  
chromodomains are modules of about 50 amino acids found in a number of proteins from yeast to mammals  the function of these proteins vary  but they are most often associated with gene silencing and chromatin remodeling events  significantly  many chromodomain containing proteins are associated on chromosomes with heterochromatin or heterochromatin like regions  reviewed in  17    
the specific role of the chromodomain is unknown  but chromodomain swapping experiments in drosophila suggest that they might be protein interaction modules  18   
thus  the data by akthar et al   2  suggests a new and rather unexpected role for these modules in rna binding  
it is intriguing to speculate that the chromodomain of other remodeling proteins also exert their activity through rna interactions and that rnas might be more common than generally appreciated in transcriptional regulation  
ordered assembly of msl proteins and rox rna increases stability of the dcc  
the first step of assembly involves the recognition of about 35 chromosomal entry sites by a predcc consisting of msl1 and msl2  
in the next step  rox2 and mle enter the complex to form a more stable primary dcc  primdcc  at these 35 sites  
spreading throughout the entire x chromosome requires the formation of the complete complex by addition of mof and msl3  
the sequential addition of new components  particularly the rox2 rna  might induce changes in the structure of already incorporated components  illustrated by ovals becoming circles   increasing the stability of the dcc  
the role of rox1 rna is not clear  but it is integrated late in this process  together with or after mof and msl3  rox1 might provide additional stability to the mature dcc  matdcc   
so  rox1 and rox2 might be partially redundant  
multiple rna protein interactions within the dcc 
how can we reconcile the findings of akthar et al   2  and meller et al   1   
keeping this cautious note in mind  a more attractive alternative could be envisioned  
the main proposition of this model is that rox2 can interact with both mle and mof  and perhaps even other msl proteins  as both rox rnas are certainly large enough to accommodate binding sites for several proteins  6   
the addition of each new component might therefore strengthen existing interactions by optimizing contacts between binding surfaces through adjustments in the higher order structure of the components  figure 1   
evidence from co immunoprecipitation experiments indicates that msl1 and msl2 interact directly with each other  a notion supported by the msl1 msl2 association at the 35 chromosomal entry sites in the absence of any other msls  the predcc  figure 1   
the addition of both mle and rox2 rna might allow the formation of a primary complex  the primdcc   which might be stabilized by the direct interaction of a structural motif of rox2 rna with the mle protein  as well as interactions of this complex with msl1 and msl2  
the primdcc might then be reinforced by the addition of the remaining two proteins  msl3 and mof  one or both of which might recognize other motifs within the rox2 rna  to form the mature complex  matdcc   
finally  matdcc might be further stabilized by the addition of rox1 rna  which could interact with several of the msls and perhaps rox2 rna as well  
one major task at hand now will be to resolve the specificities of the proposed interactions between the various msl proteins and the rox rnas  
an alternative might be to establish a heterologous in vivo system such as yeast  where protein protein and rna protein interactions can be readily detected using sensitive reporter assays  
a second important question is whether the rox genes have the same  overlapping or complementing functions  
furthermore  rox1 and rox2 are only the first two of about 35 chromatin entry sites  although perhaps they are the most important ones  
the nature of the remaining 33 sites is entirely unclear and there is  as yet  no evidence that they contain other rox like rnas  
this brings us to the largest of all mysteries  namely how the dcc is spread along the x chromosome  
one possibility is that the remaining 33 or so sites are   stations  that serve as spreading facilitators in the form of dna elements  
thus  primdccs and or mature  mat  dccs  originating from the rox entry sites  might hop from one   station   to the next and eventually reach all the entry sites distributed along the entire x chromosome  1   
from these sites  they then reach into the neighboring chromatin regions by yet another mechanism  
one final thought  the dosage compensation machinery in c  elegans acts on the two x chromosomes in the hermaphrodite by twofold down regulation of gene expression  
six proteins are essential for this process and they associate with the x chromosomes  four of them are related to factors involved in chromosome condensation during mitosis in other systems
